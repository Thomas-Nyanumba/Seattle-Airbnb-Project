## Introduction 
This project [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fxXnTsC5yYaGjR8h4mJGWjo_pQ7d6bGm/view?usp=drive_link) represents a detailed SQL analysis of Airbnb listings in Seattle, conducted as part of the *Analytics Extra Data Analytics Mentorship Program*. The analysis explores various aspects of the Airbnb market, including pricing trends, host revenue, guest sentiment, and seasonal trends. This project demonstrates my proficiency in SQL through data cleaning, transformation, aggregation, and insightful analysis.
