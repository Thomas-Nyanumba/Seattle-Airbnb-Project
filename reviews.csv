3441450,15991147,,1002026,Joff,Well organized and very friendly. Thanks a lot for letting me stay!
25115867,300702533,,100208111,Jarrett,"Place was great. Spacious and clean, good location. Host was very responsive."
25870982,279838291,,100250766,Yanran,"Magic’s house is really clean and located in a quiet and convenient neighborhood. He is really helpful in giving the tips, placing the luggage!!!"
6365330,32855221,,10033590,Amy,"Wonderful, thoughtful hostess. We were comfortable and look forward to coming back to Cozy Home."
47101995,4.13E+17,,100401301,Kui,"I've stayed in Seattle once a year for the past 8 years and Eytan's place is in the top 3. The lower floor is about 300 SF and includes a large TV, a full kitchen and a dining table for 3. Also available is a full size washer and dryer which adds a nice touch for a the traveling worker since it allows me travel with less clothing overall.<br/>A wrap around stairway leads to the bedroom on the 2nd floor. The bed is suspended by threaded rods. As a professional structural engineer, I can say that the bed was sturdy you could easily put two people on it without realizing it was suspended. Although the bed is close to the ceiling, you can easily sit up right without any issue. Directly over your head is a window that allows fresh air in at night. Like most places in seattle, the home is not air conditioned however, I've only ever seen one AC in all of seattle during my years here.<br/>The bathroom is full size and there are many different hair products to choose from. <br/>Windows are plentiful throughout the space as well.<br/>A parking spot is also included with the rental however, you really cant fit much more than a medium sized sedan such as a Toyota Camry. As a daily driver in NYC, parking wasn't a challenge and you can do it in one move, but I can see it being a challenge for some.<br/>There is a family community around here, and in the summer time, its likely you'll sleep with the windows open. You may hear some kids playing or planes getting ready to land but it wasn't really bothersome and expected in a dense urban city.<br/>The GPS gives you directions to a gate that leads to the house, but the driveway is actually around the corner. It wasn't exactly obvious and I'll admit, I did not read any instructions on how to get to the driveway, I just got lucky and found it. If its not in the instructions, perhaps including a google map aerial view with arrows pointing on how to get to the driveway might make it easier for others.<br/>Overall, this was a very pleasant stay. The house was clean and well equipped. I would absolutely stay here again!"
33276085,453778435,,100426360,Reyanne,"This place is wonderful! Don is so thoughtful & quick to respond. We had a great time in his beautiful home. Very nice location, close to everything. Book if you can!!"
28781499,330662496,,100574520,Laura,"My husband and I stayed two nights and couldn't be happier with this place! Tucked away in a quiet neighborhood but still close to many dining options. The separate studio unit is above the garage- we weren't sure what to expect, but it was great! Still very private from the rest of the house. The mid-century modern furniture and decorating looked perfect with the house architecture and the place was ultra-cozy. Super comfy bed! All the amenities were thoughtfully there. We had a wonderful, relaxed time and definitely would go back and/or recommend this place!"
2118253,11522713,,10063533,Duane,Excellent host. Melissa was extremely accommodating and she was only a phone call away. Her place is the perfect hotel replacement.
18809004,155207437,,100640574,Nobian,"I enjoyed the stay, the pull out beds were very comfortable, and the location was great."
44318220,646436061,,100800661,Ayrik,Excellent base for exploring Seattle. Plenty of free street parking. Hosts are super kind and have the cutest puppy. The cottage is modern and utilizes the space well. We enjoyed our mornings before adventuring on the private deck enclosed in a bamboo fence. Comfy bed and everything was super clean. They even have a blue light filter fan that kills virus’! I’ll keep an eye out for this place next time I’m planning a trip to Seattle.
54149987,6.12E+17,,10087741,Jason,"Joe has put a great amount of care into every detail of the unit. The high ceilings and open light filled space overlooking the sound gave my stay a truly special feel. The beautiful sunsets and mountain views only added to the calming experience I felt while in the unit. The beds were ultra-comfortable and the kitchen and coffee bar provided all the best tools when I cooked at home or enjoyed my morning coffee looking out the windows. The area is amazing too with the beach and neighborhood restaurants/stores like Bakers, Sunny Hill, and Molly’s wine shop short walks away."
15554062,110991258,,100917583,Jus,The host was on time.
43609683,642340310,,1010133,Osagyefo,Such a great space and host !
24848205,272631482,,101134629,Kristin,"Brian’s place is amazing. The space is immaculate and spacious with extra amenities to make your stay even nicer. Brian is super helpful in communicating and checking in during your stay. Additionally, the location is great for catching the bus or walking up to Wallingford or down to gasworks. Definitely 5 star and will be recommending!"
36770186,507697572,,101161521,Dorothy,Spot on perfect for a visit to Seattle. The place is at a great location - we walked to everything. And when we didnt we had uber and the monorail to help us get around. The apartment is beautifully furnished and well stocked for what you might need for a quick trip or even an extended stay. It was clean and very welcoming. We really enjoyed our visit to Seattle and will recommemd this place to any friends and family looking for accomodations in Seattle.
16928699,133329449,,101299238,Jack,"-Martin was a very kind and courteous host.<br/>-He lives in a separate unit downstairs and is easily available if needed.<br/>-We had a late flight and he was able to accommodate our later check-in (8:00pm). -Plenty of street parking.<br/>-Quiet and safe neighborhood.<br/>-Very cozy home.<br/>-Great location, close to Capitol and Pike Place Market.<br/>Would definitely stay at Martin's lovely home should we find ourselves in Seattle again.<br/>"
19966378,179576315,,101443913,Allison,"This is a great apartment at the back of a house with private entrance and very private feel. The location is great - close to many shops and restaurants in Queen Anne. We also walked to Seattle Center, which was nice. The apartment is incredibly clean and had everything stocked that we needed. Dave is a great host. We would recommend this to others and would definitely stay there again!"
44519578,8.61E+17,,101556912,Mary Ann,"Clean. Safe. Relaxing. Just a few adjectives we’d use to describe this unit. <br/>Our family could not love this new gem in the Laurelhurst area enough. Conveniently located for travel into UVillage or Downtown Seattle, but surrounded by parks and neighborhood amenities.<br/>The interior is top notch; great furniture and decor, modern appliances, and plenty of room to spend time together as a family while not being stacked on top of one another. Easily houses our family of five.<br/>This would be a great space for anyone visiting the University for seminars, conferences, or other events. It would also be fantastic for any families or professionals who want to live close to Children’s hospital. This unit has everything you need to stay for a week or for three months. <br/>When we visit our family in Seattle again, we will want to stay here. We’ll probably plan to stay longer if we can grab this unit as it feels like an extension of home and removed the stress of traveling with a young family."
1647216,15647128,,1016062,Katherine,"I stayed in Melissa's unit for one week while attending a local conference in mid-July. The unit was very clean, and located in an incredibly convenient part of town. I was able to get on the bus and make it to everywhere I needed to go. There were a lot of good restaurants within walking distance.<br/><br/>Melissa was very easy to reach by text message if I needed anything throughout my stay.<br/><br/>The only negatives were that the futon was not very comfortable, and the room did not have any air conditioning (normal for Seattle, but still warm). <br/><br/>Overall, I would stay here again due to the convenience and location."
51650986,5.05E+17,,101653778,Honey,"Genesis and Tyree’s place is wonderful. I was a travel nurse staying for long term during my contract in Seattle and this airbnb was exactly what I needed. The apartment comes with basically anything you could think of. I’ve enjoyed the keurig, air fryer and using all the supplied cookware. It’s hard to maintain your home habits and cook at home when you’re traveling for work but Genesis and Tyree made it easy for me. The home is beautiful and aesthetically pleasing. The bed is super comfortable, the couch is comfortable. The link rail station is literally around the corner, which was so convenient. Oh also, the door uses a passcode instead of a key which I love, you can’t lock yourself out! Genesis was very quick to respond to inquiries and pleasant to interact with. Highly recommend!"
9407255,182504648,,101854933,Munira,"We had a great stay at LaDora's place. She was very accommodating and helpful from letting us check in early to checking out late to recommending great food and drinks spots . She was a great host!. The house itself was immaculate, amazing views from the porch, clean, perfect location and just beautiful in general. Definitely recommend this house to others and if we come back to Seattle we are definitely staying here."
17569817,139292097,,101979610,Gina,This gorgeous house was perfect for housing a group and hosting a dinner gathering. Its proximity to the light rail was a huge plus. We'd definitely stay here again!
27492046,302574446,,102005878,Mat,Great
26562018,302609094,,102017280,Laurenn,Great little home in the heart of Seattle. Just a quick 5 minute drive to the waterfront and easy to get around. Host Heather was quick to respond to any and all questions. Great experience for our first Airbnb stay!
13732104,113757316,,10214243,Lydia,Couldn't have asked for a better location.
20759864,221471222,,102252038,Beth,This apartment is cozy and clean and perfectly appointed from the colors of the towels and blankets to the coffee cups. There were fresh flowers in the bedroom. The sofa creates a very comfortable queen-size bed. The location is two blocks from a grocery store and three blocks from a diner. We had a lovely time and hope to return in the future.
46166273,768395410,,102280323,Mary,"The loft had over-the-top amenities, furnishings, bed comfort, BBQ / deck area with plenty of furniture for relaxing conversation. It was so convenient to the Seattle area."
50098962,5.21E+17,,102296282,Brittany,"Michelle was the best host and the Airbnb was perfect for our 2 month stay. Everything was clean, well taken care of and exactly as described. Location was perfect! We were able to walk to a beautiful lake and park and walk/Uber to many restaurants/bars. Michelle was so kind and generous, as well as responsive. Could not give this Airbnb enough stars!!"
12968264,78312666,,10233205,Ande,"Charlie's place is great! You can't beat the location, it's central and yet just feels like a quiet slice of life in a neighborhood on the water. The classic Seattle craftsman house is open and bright and newly remodeled (in fact, minor parts were still in progress) with a minimalist, modern feel. I made a very last minute reservation so Charlie was out of town but his dad Kevin made me feel welcome and checked in regularly and even brought by some chairs for the porch because it was nice out. Whether you're visiting Seattle or from Seattle, this is a great place for 1 or 2 people to kick their feet up and while away the evening watching the passing boats, bikers, joggers, and walkers."
49113826,3.91E+17,,102501807,Chris Eunsang,Unexpectedly the place was like new home since it got recently refreshed. Xiao was very reponsive and easy to communicate with. We really enjoyed this compy home and proximity to downtown Seattle. Thanks Xiao!
34976195,459741290,,10250827,Nikki,Great place in the center of Fremont. Easy to use door codes for each room. Everything is very clean and new. I would recommend for anyone staying in the north seattle area.
14049107,106707633,,10274827,Sandra,We loved our stay in this beautiful quiet space in a lovely neighborhood. Highly recommend this spot if looking for easy access to Univ of Wash or Seattle Children's. We would be happy to stay here again.
30237428,425712100,,102797398,Suzanne,"Victoria’s place was sparkling clean and new, like we were the very first guests to stay there! Comfy beds, tons of towels, a super good coffee maker, and a lovely firepit in the private yard. The neighborhood is fabulous for taking walks, and grocery stores are only 8 blocks away. Victoria was very responsive. We would definitely stay there again."
15337460,114615898,,102899713,Chris,"This was our first time using Airbnb, and the experience was amazing. Natasha was so welcoming, and the basement area we stayed in was better than we expected. She had all the essentials for us, and to top it off she had a pool table for entertainment. It definitely felt like our own home with the private entrance, also it's located in a great neighborhood. Definitely recommend staying here!"
37946126,556170927,,103278578,Jessi,"Cozy, clean house in a quiet, good location. Great value!"
33250388,434902130,,103452265,Karla,Lovely place only minutes away from downtown Seattle. Very cozy and clean. Definitely recommended! Also great hospitality!
2297917,10376642,,10347652,Laly,"We had a very nice time, the place was so comfortable that we barely left. Fantastic little spot for a nice little romantic getaway, highly recommended!"
15820436,115095706,,103550525,Josh,"Abe was able to arrange pickup from airport by his concierge.<br/>Both Abe and cedrick were in contact throughout the process"
9.47E+17,9.77E+17,,103608683,April,Love how quiet and relaxing the neighborhood was. Beautiful interior.
31040215,416522592,,103637337,Chelsea,"Staying with Alice truly felt like staying with friends who were ready to provide anything needed, from an ironing board to get ready for a wedding, to a gift certificate to the local bakery/coffee shop to give a direction for exploration. When my husband and I arrived, we were not expecting the warm, thorough welcome Alice provided with a full walk through of the apartment, amenities and an invitation to enjoy cinnamon rolls the next morning. The space itself was immaculately clean, spacious and yet cozy. Perfect for one or two guests. The view couldn’t be any better, with direct view of the water, and the Seattle skyline from the large bedroom windows. Great after a day of wedding festivities to know we had a warm, clean place nearby to rest."
20586623,190752778,,103749471,Steven,This place is definitely worth a stay in West Seattle. Nancy was a great host and provided everything I needed. Also be sure to follow her suggestions for places to eat and visit.
23943343,306583082,,103780699,Jayne,"If I moved to Seattle, I would want a house like Alyson's in that exact spot on Green Lake. The space was completely comfortable for our three families (11 total - 5 adults, 6 kids) to share. We loved being so close to Green Lake, where we did morning walks and swam in a lifeguarded area every day and then took a dip in the jacuzzi. The location is very close to bus stops into center city, great restaurants and shops so we did not need a car or miss having one. The kitchen is well equipped for cooking and three bathrooms were clutch. Alyson was a great host that she was easy to reach by text message if we needed her."
39907322,5.77E+17,,103852970,Emil,"Awesome Airbnb, very nice modern finished in a very cute house! Clean and a lot of light! One of the best Airbnbs I’ve been in! Def recommend!"
1820794,9741853,,10393765,Bernadette,"I stayed with Pam & Patrick for a month. It was an amazing experience.<br/><br/>First, their location is unbeatable. The cozy apartment is located in Queen Anne which is a very nice neighborhood. It's located at the top of the hill. So be prepared to walk or drive up and down steep hills. A Midwest girl like me found this to be challenging.<br/><br/>Anyway, I could not have chosen I better neighborhood. It's close to downtown, Belltown and Capitol Hill. It's close to many restaurants, entertainment (music venues, theaters, etc.) and grocery stores too. You are about a 5 minute drive to Pike Place market.<br/><br/>I worked in Bothell (far north suburbs) but getting to the I-5 was a breeze. It's close. And it's a gateway to all of rest Seattle's awesome neighborhoods. Queen Anne is about 10 -15 mins (drive) to the U District, Ballard and Fremont. <br/><br/>The apartment was fully equipped with everything you need in the kitchen - baking goods, wine glasses, dishes, etc. My friends and I had no problem making full course dinners and baking gourmet sweets. <br/><br/>The in-unit laundry and dryer was a plus, extra towels, walk-in closet, extensive movie collection and Internet are just a few amenities that go a long way. <br/><br/>Did I mention the view? You can see the space needle from your window. This is truly a superb view. But then again you're on a hill. You have a good view anywhere you go!<br/><br/>The hosts were so accommodating! They communicate well and are willing to help you when you need it. I had guests visit me from Chicago and they lent me an air bed and extra bedding. <br/><br/>All in all, don't snooze on this place. Good hosts, good location and an apartment/studio that feels like home. Good furniture, cozy feel. Great privacy. Enjoy Seattle with ease staying at this place. <br/><br/>"
25087100,266824924,,1040639,Sara,"Great space. Very clean and quiet in a cute neighborhood within driving distance to several nice neighborhoods. I felt safe, welcomed, and comfortable. I would definitely stay here again and recommend to friends."
12566321,115734736,,104125173,Paul,"Our stay at Red Door Flats was everything we could have hoped for in terms of comfort, security, and convenience. The space is beautifully furnished with everything you might need for a two night stay or a week. The kitchen was equipped with high end appliances combined with a clean and useable layout. The bed was super comfortable, and came with two quilts for those who run hot or cold. The bath fixtures are truly luxurious, with a big walk in shower, lots of vanity space and a separate water closet for privacy, all equipped with heated floors. The flat even includes a laundry space with washer and dryer. <br/><br/>Our hosts were warm and welcoming, and provided a lot of nice touches, like fresh baked muffins waiting for us when we arrived. The unit is very private, and it was left to us how much we interacted, but Carol and Ian were a great source of information about Seattle and surroundings, and were fun folks to visit with. The flat was a great private space to retire to, with high ceilings and lots of light.<br/><br/>We would not hesitate to recommend this property to anyone who wants to be close to downtown ( 10 minutes away ) but still wants to be in a great Seattle neighbourhood with its own collection of wonderful eating and drinking venues. West Seattle is one of Seattle's best kept secrets that maintains a small town feel on the edge of the big city. <br/><br/>We had a lovely stay which was far too short, but we know we'll be back on our next visit to Seattle. Many thanks to our wonderful hosts Carol and Ian.<br/><br/><br/><br/>"
44281181,704020563,,104177254,Jennifer,"This apartment was perfect for a long term stay while my husband and I sold our house and looked for a new house in Seattle! The kitchen is well equipped and the little balcony is a nice place to sit outside. It is an old house with hardwood floors so the unit upstairs can be a little noisy when people are walking around - but nothing out of the ordinary. Everything was very clean when we checked in and there were extra amenities like towels, shampoo, soap, etc."
12456183,117072207,,104531624,Omar,Emma's is the best words cant explain!
41299302,595116661,,104675548,Kiran,"We came to Seattle for the weekend to celebrate our girlfriends birthday. The house was BEYOND what we were expecting. It was immaculately clean, well furnished, stylish and very comfortable. We will DEFINITELY be staying here again and again!"
34841878,472499162,,104770393,Shivani,Good host
5.73E+17,6.4E+17,,104910334,Sarah,"This is a beautiful little upgraded apartment in a quiet neighborhood. The backyard is a great place to sit and enjoy the beautiful flowers and greenery. I love the private, covered parking spot as well as the laundry facilities. Alaina is a great host quick to respond to any questions or concerns. Close to the I-5, public transportation, and hospital. Would highly recommend staying here."
45712983,765010680,,105046669,Vikranth,"My girlfriend and I had a great stay here. The location is ideal for Seattle, close to the train station to get to/fro the airport, and walkable to most things you would want to do.The room was clean, comfortable, and Natalia was very responsive."
25113399,268058710,,105427737,Victoria,"Fantastic experience! This home is wonderful, artfully decorated, very very comfortable, conveniently located, has every single amenity one could need while staying away from your own home. <br/>The building is secure. The pool and spa were clean and empty when we had the opportunity to enjoy it. A restaurant on the steps was open at midnight when we got back from a concert. A big plus. We were very close to the light rail station and Pike Place market. No need for driving or taxis. <br/>There was nothing left for wanting in this home. Plenty of toiletries, towels, reading materials, electric outlets and access to laundry facilities if we had the need. We were always on the go, but Bill offered plenty of refreshments if we desired. The plush and comfortable king-sized bed was heavenly. I haven't slept so soundly in years. The bed alone is worth the stay.<br/>But the best quality are the hosts. Bill and Jimi are not only accommodating and kind they were eager to get to know us, so they could accurately recommend dining locations and fun things to do during our stay.<br/>This was our first time staying at an Airbnb and it was an amazing experience. We felt like we were very welcome and were treated like good friends."
15550339,121727734,,105759614,Harrison,Very nice place and surprisingly spacious.
26747050,296439414,,105762829,Roberta,"Excellent stay, everything was very organized and clean and Amy is a great host. I recommend it."
6.13E+17,7.32E+17,,10577068,Francis,Awesome apartment in a great location. View of the Space Needle from the balcony! Communication with Rick was swift and easy. I highly recommend.
16407622,123104323,,106043086,Leo,"great place, even greater guy. super easy process and location is great. very accommodating!"
52941353,4.93E+17,,106182107,Donald,"On a recent visit to the Seattle area circumstances caused us to stay with a series of five different hosts in the west Seattle area in a short period of time . Ali’s place was by far the best of the five.<br/>The site is exceptionally large and spacious. Everything worked well. The beds and furniture were exceptionally comfortable lived in feel. The location had close, accessible parking along with bus stops to take you downtown in minutes. This host was also very easy to work with. <br/>But the big thing is the spaciousness of the area. That extra space was just so relaxing."
20096729,192651540,,106319264,Woody,"Alice was super helpful, the place was perfect. We had a great night!"
6.2E+17,6.53E+17,,10662442,Maya,"This home is in a great location and was very cute and clean. There seemed to be some kinks to work out though - missing kitchen essentials and hosts who were unable to take care of some issues during our stay. Overall I would recommend as I’m sure it will improve as they receive more feedback from guests. Also, you can park on the street overnight despite how parking was described."
1732441,9433944,,10663274,Kate,"I was there with my wife, sister and dog, we all had a great time without any inconvenience and 200% satisfied with Marcell's hospitality. The house had everything that I needed and perfect location for trip in Seattle. Clean, comfortable, cozy and beautiful. I already miss that place. Furthermore, Marcell is very thoughtful and kind, he will do anything for your convenience. He is the best host who I have ever met through Airbnb,"
25002,37440,,106760,Anthony,"First, would I stay here again - YES. The room is a little funky because its a converted garage, but its not expensive either. The bed is most comfortable you will ever find, the bathroom is totally new and very well done, the back yard is lovely, and Amanda is very considerate host. Stay here."
17228224,469527206,,106792747,Gabriel,"Consider yourself to live inside a family, act as you're a part of it"
24888909,262988366,,106864699,Jared,Excellent place to stay. Central to the locations we were visiting and easy to get around. Great studio style apartment with easy check in. Would stay again.
42353206,613280559,,106884245,Newman,Great place to stay. Allen is very responsive and communicates quickly.
30916586,360218795,,10694931,Christopher,"This was a great place to stay for a great price. It was so close to everything: the Sound, the Seattle Center, Queen Anne, downtown, etc. The room and house were tastefully decorated and clean. Mahnaz was friendly, communicated everything clearly, responded promptly, and there were no issues with check in or check out. I would definitely recommend this place to others!"
26888506,295006500,,107083185,Diego,"Betsy's apartment was absolutely amazing, it had everything from great breakfast choices to a stylish and comfy living room. Bathroom had unique feel and the towels were super soft. Was also very close to downtown which was a major plus for me."
18250300,159806303,,107094648,Cristine,Tom's place was great! There was four of us and it worked perfectly. Had a great stay.
31476418,402826833,,107179775,Julie,"New, clean space. Nice, safe neighborhood. Entrance is steps but wide and solid. View to cute backyard garden. Close to Chittenden locks and garden. Would stay here again!"
13654492,92353141,,10733020,Chelsea,"I loved the Green Room. Comfortable, immaculately clean, great location. Ashley was the best host I've had yet. She made us feel so welcome, was very responsive and helpful and gave us tips for our stay in Seattle. Will definitely stay again!"
18058644,151421961,,10739623,Andrew,"Perfect! We stayed for an entire month, and we were so sad to leave because the house was that amazing. Best part was the location, 15 minutes or less to downtown Seattle, few minutes to the airport, and 15 minutes to the eastside. Perfect for long term guests, families, and groups. The house is newer, and spacious. It had all the amenities we needed to cook and feel at home. Michelle is really helpful and was always prompt with inquiry responses. I highly recommend!"
10675363,83039900,,107760,Matt,"Alan's Apartment has been great and we enjoyed staying there very much! We had a warm welcome and everything we could need was there! The garden is lovely and you are welcome to use it! There is a big supermarket in walking distance and some good restaurants as well. We liked ""Mr and Mrs Wok"" (Asian fusion).<br/>There is free parking right outside the house and a bus stop a couple blocks away that takes you to downtown Seattle. Overall a great place that I can highly recommend!"
41601121,600871856,,107772486,?,"Quite near metro station.Fast accessibly to the Airport.Nice decoration.Elaborate living instructions from check-in to check-out.Shortcoming may be too much noise in the morning due to wooden structure,and a little bit cold for bathing water.But to those who get used to,it's fine."
35339569,658730946,,107811460,Julia,Nice cute basement space with a fully functional kitchen and bedroom.. Pictures don't really reflect what the space looks like (different furniture and lighting) but that's okay. Close drive to Alki beach. Safe neighborhood as well. Good for 2 people needing a place to crash while they visit the area!
38356001,4.96E+17,,107965914,Jason,"New, beautiful house with great amenities. Quiet, relaxing and clean. Thank you for a great stay!"
44660894,4.37E+17,,108032970,Shawn,Dylan was truly above and beyond. This location is worth it. You won’t want to leave. Strongly recommend.
22867908,242916592,,108041042,Caesar,Ariana and her family provided a lovely place to stay for the weekend. Very close to public transportation (that's all we took) and groceries. Very quick in communicating and reacting when we needed help. The place itself is VERY clean and provided some cute unexpected amenities like breakfast and fresh fruit (please respect the NO SHOES rules! :) ).<br/>Thank you Ariana! :)
11335586,64661343,,10824454,Danielle,"Cozy, convenient and quiet. Despite being across the street from the local fire dept., this apartment was actually very quiet and serene. New deluxe furnishings & a comfy bed made for a nice getaway. Jessica was a great host, quick to respond and very helpful. <br/>The location was so centrally located that we didn't even need a car! We fell in love with Capitol Hill- will definitely be back."
17573676,156488616,,108302193,Christopher,"What a great home for our two-week stay in Seattle! Everything in the home is brand new, contemporary, and easy to use, requiring minimal effort. Access to the front door and garage were a piece of cake. I loved going for morning runs along Lake Union (and not needing a key). The rooms suited my family perfectly, with large beds, separate bathrooms, and a open common space. The kitchen was extremely well appointed. The roof deck has amazing fews of the city and the Olympic mountains that never get old. We were also a short walk to some great restaurants (you have to try Joule) and nightlife in Fremont."
27106446,306620084,,10833533,Andy,"A nice bright space for a basement apartment. A great neighborhood near Green Lake and the University-- an excellent jumping off spot that beat prior stays in downtown/ Capital Hill area. The unit itself is brand new and comfortable. We enjoyed our time there, and would recommend it to anyone."
27607985,352756004,,108461883,Garry,"Look no further for your Air BnB in Seattle. A newer, cleaner, best location can't be found. We would recommend you book well in advance as this unit likely won't be available on a short term request. A short five minute walk brings you to Madison, and that is also where the Seattle Arboretum and Japanese Gardens are. It's also on the main bus route to downtown Seattle!<br/>The location is also a very quiet residential area and the neighbors are very friendly if you run into any of them. <br/>By car or walking Washington Lake and public park areas are very close.<br/>A total array of amenities are available including; four burner electric stove and oven, microwave, dish washer, refrigerator, washer/dryer, three piece bathroom, KING size very comfortable bed, two flat screenTV's, remote cozy fireplace. The kitchen is complete with pots, pans, dishes, cutlery, and miscellaneous utensils.<br/>Tom is a super host and very quick to reply to any questions you might have. we stayed four nights and would definitely book this BnB again. <br/>Garry and Lynne Alberta, Canada"
17075365,139311529,,108587408,Aaron,"Great place and great hosts! Grace and Benson were so welcoming and accommodating to any needs! The place is in a perfect location...close to bus stops and a quick ride downtown and Capital hill. The place is amazing, beautifully decorated, cozy, and comfortable. I am a medical student and was doing a rotation at Harborview, which was only a 10 minute bus ride...very convenient! Parking was always available, also very convenient!"
23996840,269721933,,108619059,Trevor,"Whitney is a great host! Her loft is very clean, modern, cozy, and welcoming. definitely going to stay here again the next time I am in Seattle!"
31649637,406228299,,108689,Anne,"I had the pleasure and honor of being the first guest to stay in this absolutely pristine thoughtfully put together super clean studio space. Cara was so easy to communicate with, we didn’t end up meeting because of my schedule, though I always knew she right there and available to help with anything related to the stay. We were in touch through Airbnb messages throughout the stay. It felt more like a space I’d love to live in in another life. I didn’t use the kitchen, but it looks so lovely complete with induction burner, hood, refrigerator, dishwasher and so on. Grateful also for being able to park in the driveway during my visit. <br/>If you enjoy a beautifully designed luxurious space, wonderful bed with white sheets and covers and enjoy Capitol Hill this place is a treasure."
52369825,4.9E+17,,10876588,Qi,Fantastic! The apartment was super clean and everything is well organized! Feels like home! The hosts are awesome and extremely helpful!

44135289,736856288,,109499304,Jacqueline,"This space is gorgeous. It is an amazing area with a gorgeous view from the roof top. The neighborhood is a beautiful, quiet area and just a short drive to some amazing places. The hosts communication was amazing and I loved the welcome note left for me. I would highly recommend staying here. If I am in the area again and need a place to stay, I will absolutely return!"
53278095,5.9E+17,,109701263,Paula,"This Airbnb is SUCH a gem! New construction building in a great location in Capitol Hill with a ton of coffee shops, restaurants, shops, bars, grocery stores, and parks all within walking distance. The unit itself has fantastic views and is beautifully decorated and well stocked, including in-unit washer and dryer which was really nice for my week-long stay. The wifi is fast and it was super easy to work from home here (and the place was so cute, people on zoom kept asking me where I was :)) Don't think twice about booking Jane's place - you'll love staying here!!"
12704096,147267419,,10982339,Jasmine,"I felt very welcomed in this cozy home just a block from the bus stop to downtown- I caught a direct bus to Pike Place Market, no transfers needed! My private room had lovely touches like a remote controlled fireplace and big bay windows, and I could make myself a yummy organic breakfast with the complimentary goodies from the cupboards :) Host was very gracious in helping me to settle in and from there I was pretty much all set. I would be happy to stay again, thank you!"
44197192,659476341,,109921389,Erica,"I had a great time staying at Lori's place in Capitol Hill. The apartment was well furnished and very clean. Since I was the first to stay in the apartment it was missing a few simple things like cleaning supplies but Miles and Lori were very quick and responding and getting me the things I requested to make the place better. The location was perfect; close to grocery stores, restaurants, small markets, coffee shops, a park, close to an exit. I would highly recommend this place and would also suggest to reserve the parking spot if it's available! I didn't and wished that I had (city parking is hard at night)."
18266409,146401896,,109925425,Oscar,It was good
53024480,5.78E+17,,109949445,Michael Jed,"We stayed here for a month. The apartment is in a prime location in DT Seattle. Walking distance to everything and didn’t really need a car unless we went down south or Ballard. The apartment was definitely cozy but it was only my girlfriend and I and our frenchie dog, so it was perfect. They even provided some cleaning supplies, coffee, and detergent. We would definitely recommend this place and would stay again!"
4550535,155795320,,110318824,Renu,"Apartment is in a safe part of Seattle which is also close to public transit, UVillage, Whole Foods and restaurants. Melissa is a very professional and responsive host."
36237271,733535734,,110330963,Matt,It was a very nice place to stay! Will certainly visit again.
8.81E+17,9.14E+17,,110341178,Celina,"Beautiful home, and excellent host who made sure we were doing well. Everything was clean and spotless, and there were many utilities (air fryer!) Would highly recommend this airbnb."
21647807,210917959,,110345755,Rike,"It was nice to stay at Seyeds place. He was a great host and his house was very comfy, modern and clean. Unfortunatly we did not use the Hot Tub but maybe next time if we visit another time Seattle and Seyeds place. :D"
25982024,281451467,,110370062,Kristian,"Stunning suite with a brand new fit-out. Kateryna has thought of everything you could ever need in an accommodation from appliances and linen to a detailed guestbook and little treats for guests! Location is fantastic for small eateries and cafes and for getting to and from central Seattle. We chose to Uber in and out for very cheap fares. Great stay, highly recommend Kateryna's place!"
7278583,47079901,,11039556,Charla,"WOW! What a house. I asked myself when I walked in ""is this woman crazy to rent out such a beautiful home?"" We loved this house! It was absolutely perfect for our group of 7. The location could not have been any better for us. Close to downtown by car and walking distance to the ferry but also to the cool area of Alki Beach. There are great supermarkets close by, shops, cafe's ...you name it. You don't even have to go into downtown Seattle if you don't want to. We only went to the space needle, Pike market and Filson. Besides that we enjoyed the neighborhood. Now back to Sharon and her lovely house. It was super clean and organized with directions on how to use the tv's, recycling etc you name it. There is a large den upstairs that is perfect if you have kids. There is a large screen Tv with a DVD player and Sharon has left behind some great DVDs for the kids which we all know is beneficial when you have some time to waste. Besides being clean, amazing location etc the view from our bedroom in the morning was breathtaking. We were lucky and had sun for the most part so to wake up with the sun rising above downtown Seattle was incredible. We were actually sad to leave this place. My husband now wants to move from Italy to Seattle. Enough said. Thank You Sharon for sharing your wonderful house. We really appreciate it."
2026794,9904053,,11045480,John,"Sheryl was an awesome host! Extremely knowledgeable of the city and will accommodate any reasonable request you have. The house is a ""working progress"" but you get your own room with a big bed. If you're looking for an extravagant place then this house is not for you. Very good for budget travelers!"
27908343,400642485,,110458206,Ryan,Todd’s place is very neat and in an excellent location. You have the entire bottom floor to yourself plus access to the kitchen/living room and balcony/patio on the upper levels and rooftop. Todd was extremely responsive when communicating before our arrival and through our departure. He was also very helpful in recommending things to do/places to see while staying in Seattle. I would highly recommend staying at Todd’s any day!!
25946713,288819424,,11048399,Christopher,Great location near the water and easy walk to Space Needle. Bar downstairs gets a little noisy at night.
48344827,5.83E+17,,110627647,Joaquin,"Blueground solo existió el dia de cerrar el contrato y pagar on line. A partir de después desapereció y no lo pudimos contactar nunca mas, a pesar de muchos intentos. . No vinieron ni el primer dia a enseñarnos el piso y ver como funcionaban las cosas. NO LO RECOMMIENDO A NADIE."
16579012,165331496,,11065411,Mollie,"I stayed at Stephanie's place for 3 months and was her very first guest on airbnb. She and her family were very kind and welcoming, eager to ensure that I had everything I needed and was comfortable during my stay. The apartment was fully stocked with kitchen and cleaning supplies, which is great for traveling professionals. The private entrance is also a plus as I work night shift so I often come and go at odd hours. Another positive thing (which should never be taken for granted in Seattle) was that I never had a problem parking on the block during my entire stay. Also, you are just a 15-20 minute walk from Fremont's shops and restaurants and a short drive up the hill to downtown Queen Anne (or a difficult walk if you need some exercise!). The only negative is that the washer/dryer wasn't hooked up initially, and then it broke a week before I moved out, but they let me use theirs upstairs in the meantime :)"
36563849,7.65E+17,,110683164,Magnus,"Place was exactly as described, with a good location for what we planned to do during our visit to Seattle. Host was very proactive and responsive."
31985844,471541453,,110741480,Chen,The area is amazing with the sea and downtown Ballard both within walkable distance. The place is clean and quiet. Overall great experience!
29410063,511745628,,1107424,Pamela,"We spent 6 weeks in Helen’s house and had a really great time. The location is ideal if you are visiting Seattle - close to bus lines and shops and cafes (there’s a summer Friday farmers market just 3 blocks away). The house is very well stocked with anything and everything that you will need and our kids LOVED the bunk beds and bookshelf full of books. The queen bed in the master is a soft bed (we prefer firm) and there is plenty of storage space to hang clothes and drawers to put things away. The couch is very comfortable and the Tv is a decent size ;). The backyard and deck are perfect for a bbq and the kids enjoyed playing on the grass. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone, especially with kids."
704764,3107906,,1110102,Dylan,"This is a true gem if you're looking for your own adorable 1 bedroom flat in the Queen Anne district. <br/><br/>It is a first floor apt, but since the entire home is on a hill you get astounding views of the sound. The bathroom is incredible, and the bedroom very cozy. <br/><br/>Catherine was a great hostess. She left fresh baked muffins and directions to local cafes and bakeries.<br/><br/>I will definitely stay here again when I visit Seattle and highly recommend it to everyone !"
43046080,4.12E+17,,111330173,Trinity,"Although my stay was short, I enjoyed every minute! The location is perfect. There are several restaurants and shops within a 5 minute walk, and Alki Beach was somewhere around 10-15 on an e-Bike. There are lots of scooter and bike rentals nearby which was convenient for getting to the beach without looking for parking. <br/>The unit was clean, and the backyard was a quiet peaceful escape. Didn't use the gym but the hot tub was awesome : ) For being so close to California Ave., I was surprised by how quiet it was. I could get some work done in the evening and relax. I would definitely stay here again!"
46551469,733500190,,111347092,Harmeni,This place was absolutely a great stay for our weekend getaway! Super convenient location and very easy check in process.
16650097,132394103,,111474171,June,Wonderful hosts and perfect apt with convenient amenities. We really enjoyed our stay.
24433183,258806332,,111776748,Isa,Cute and private space in a quiet but friendly neighborhood. It’s basically your own little apartment. Very close to lively part of town. Highly recommend Mark’s place!
34546567,452717497,,111847102,Stephanie,Very nice and the view was amazing!
3835995,17603861,,11185296,Scott,"Jamie and David were home when I arrived and gave me a tour/orientation of the basement apartment. They provided a Keurig and a Brita water filter in addition to the stuff in the listing, and they made me feel welcome with tips about local coffee shops, bakeries, and microbrews. We had a lovely conversation when I checked out, as well, and Jamie was responsive to my suggestions for additional items (e.g. tissues). The cottage has Craftsman architecture, lovely landscaping, and sits in a quiet residential neighborhood near Phinney Ridge. Despite the peaceful surroundings, it's a great home base from which to see Seattle... only 20 minutes by car or bus to downtown and 10 to the quirky main drags of Ballard and Fremont. Would absolutely recommend to anybody planning a visit."
22451351,295005680,,111863425,Ramona,Katherine is a very kind person and is always available when you need her. Her house is one of the best places to stay because is a very quiet neirborhood.
18345257,160161188,,111952356,Elias,"The suite was perfect! Clean, comfortable, and exactly as advertised. Only a short drive to all the restaurants and stores you need. I would love to be back next time if the host will have me."
16415616,137334860,,112016845,Mackenzie,Very handy location we were able to get downtown Seattle very easily! The place was very clean and convenient and easy to use!
24081619,265058506,,112192499,Rick,Cozy basement space. Big bathroom. Two bedrooms with real beds which is harder to find. We had one small issue but Chima responded to us almost immediately and came by within ten minutes and fixed it. Friendly host. Highly recommended.
16502894,128945952,,112418087,Charles,"Great location near public transit (e.g. bus #62 among others), shops, restaurants, Walgreens (right across the street). New, modern interior with all the amenities you could need, right down to HDMI cables. Washer/dryer is in the basement and access is easy (4 quarters per wash/dry). There are several parking spaces right on the property but even if you don't get one of those, it's quite easy to get one of the spots on the street right in front of the unit. Overall, a great place to stay and would definitely come here again!"
21888838,218949115,,112467034,Eric,"It’s a great place. Very clean and comfortable. Overall, a great value. Hopefully you don’t have the situation I did with another guest who didn’t care a damn about Lee’s rules."
39246120,560160787,,11246912,Bob (And Melissa),"We wanted a nice two-bedroom place to stay with our daughter, son-in-law and 4-month-old grandson when they visited Seattle and were lucky enough to find Luke and Marcos' place in Capitol Hill. It had only recently been finished and they asked us to let them know if they'd forgotten anything. But these guys thought of every little detail so we had very few suggestions for them!<br/>The vintage space is beautifully finished and decorated in Pinterest-worthy style. The beds were oh-so-comfortable, terry cloth robes and slippers for all, kitchen stocked with every tool a cook could need (we asked about an oyster knife and they came back within the hour with two and more kitchen things!), even a working fireplace with logs.<br/>Thank you so much for making this a wonderful visit! We'll definitely be back.<br/>Bob and Melissa"
52282887,5.01E+17,,112482693,John,"This charming and cozy apartment certainly made our month stay in Seattle very pleasant. Our hosts, James and Robyn, were friendly, helpful, and happy to share suggestions for their favorite nearby restaurants. We enjoyed taking walks in the neighborhood. We were impressed by the beautiful and unusual trees we saw, including a fig tree and some giant sequoias. We were very happy with our choice of this apartment and we most definitely recommend it."
16635898,128611168,,112550147,Ed,"Great location and condo is as advertised. Public spaces, gym, pool and hot tub are very nice additions. Hosts are friendly, responsive and professional in every sense. A very good value."
45351066,742773597,,112588428,Jiayu,"Very spatial and clean. Our heater is broken the first day and had a FaceTime with the management. The management came over and fixed it next day. <br/>Missing cooking ingredients, washer soap and hair dryer. Already suggest the host to add those on! Remember to inquiry the management before booking."
21083203,199726448,,11264395,Eric,The basement rooms are as described. It was actually quite a large space that we had to ourselves. Not just a private bedroom and bathroom but private living room and kitchen area as well. That along with the separate entrance made it feel more like our own private apartment which was a nice surprise given the very reasonable rate. The house itself is beautiful with a great view in a great neighborhood. But it is very sparsely furnished and lacking that comfortable lived in feel. Not really a place to hang out in at this point but the potential is there. Ronak seems like he is new to hosting but he was very communicative and accommodating. Overall it was a great value with lots of potential.
22355702,258842702,,112754094,Suzanne,"this is a comfortable, clean and nicely appointed space. that first cup of coffee was right there waiting to be made in the morning."
6166307,32198529,,11278939,Elisabeth,"First thought that came to my mind when I walked in to the apartment was, ""Wow, this place is gorgeous!"" It was exactly as described and shown in the pictures, very clean, modern, and comfortable. The TV was amazing...I used the Roku to watch Hulu as well as HBO Go while relaxing in bed at night. The bed is so comfortable...the sheets were soft and the comforter had a nice weight and feel to it. The apartment is filled with light thanks to the huge windows that were almost floor to ceiling while at the same time providing a lot of privacy. The curtains blacked out the bedroom light nicely so I could easily sleep in. This place came with all the amenities one would want or need: washer/dryer, dishwasher, tv with roku and HBO, keyless entry system. I absolutely loved the Greenwood neighborhood, often waking to Greenwood Ave and to the Phinney Ridge neighborhood where I found amazing local bookstores, restaurants, reflexology, vintage shops, and a library. Lastly, the owners were so nice, checking in with me via text and always were available if there was anything I needed. I can't say enough positive things about this place...I loved it! Perfect Airbnb experience. I use Airbnb everywhere I travel, and this place is in my top favorite places to stay now. I felt very at home here and wish I could stay for a longer time, but would love to stay here again in the future! :)"

8.11E+17,8.28E+17,,113302504,Margarita,It's the first door past the fence. Don't go all the way back. Nice place if you are out and about and just a place to crash. The location is right off the highway. Close to the city. It's better to park on the street bc parking is complicated to park on the property if someone else is also renting.
51643422,4.87E+17,,11340269,Evan,Clean and safe accommodation for an extended stay. Spent the month here and enjoyed both the apartment and the neighborhood. Washer + Dryer in unit was also a major plus as well as reliable internet that didn’t lag (for those working from home). Thanks Tali!
3505829,16919242,,1134383,Chris,Don was very easy to work with and a great communicator. Our team enjoyed the beautiful home and it was very convenient to our downtown work location. Everything was clean and as described in the listing.
50328620,4.18E+17,,11348006,Natalie,"We had such a lovely stay at Mike’s beachside home. It was the perfect midway landing spot for a coastal camping road trip (laundry! Shower with great water pressure!). It is in an adorable residential neighborhood with private beach access — truly majestic sunset views of the Puget Sound. It is a short drive away from excellent food, nature, and provides easy access to day trip adventures. It worked perfectly for us!<br/>It’s not your run of the mill “instagram-able” Airbnb, but it was super comfortable, spacious, and cozy. The price couldn’t be beat! No A/C but it stays plenty cool by the water. Be mindful of sorting trash/compost appropriately - and keep an eye out for the occasional fruit fly.<br/>We would absolutely come back again. Thanks for your hospitality, Mike!"
5653726,28360989,,11379143,Eric,"Melissa provided a welcoming greeting the first night and asked if we had any additional needs. It was good to have a comfortable and pleasant place to stay while staying in Seattle to be with family members during their medical treatment. <br/>I have found this location central to food and access to university service. <br/>Thank you Melissa for your hospitality, kindness and generosity. Your grace and helpfulness has provided a positive influence in my stay.<br/>Peace be with you and your family."
30130681,353165577,,11379661,Cameron,"Truly a wonderful place to stay in Seattle. The location is about as good as it gets, right in the thick of Capitol Hill with plenty to see and do nearby (and eat and drink!).<br/>The apartment itself was absolutely spotless and the pictures show you exactly what you'll get; a well designed, thoughtfully laid-out, new apartment. <br/>Though we didn't interact much with Brandon, all communication we did have was prompt and informative. I'd highly recommend this space and wouldn't hesitate to stay here again next time I'm in Seattle!"
50049614,765192827,,113908932,Rajeev,"Excellent location. Cozy place. Communicative hosts. We would stay there again, next time we’re in Seattle."
14108770,92099347,,11424895,Alisha,"Sharsti and Chad were very welcoming and helpful via text; I didn't see either of them until the end of my trip, as I was away most of the time. The casita was clean, cozy, quiet, and conveniently located. It got a little warm at times because there are only two small windows (the big window had no screen) and a ceiling fan, but the weather was mild enough where it wasn't an issue. Sharsti and Chad provided a small booklet with suggestions of what to do and where to go, which was nice. :) I would recommend staying here if you want a comfy place to crash and will be out most of the time."
32526287,419801199,,114254221,Chris,This Studio is lovely! The space enough for two people.<br/>Location is great and close to everything.<br/>The bed was super comfy.<br/>If you’re looking to visit Seattle this is the best location and place to be.

52724069,9.36E+17,,114420896,Tyson,Our family of five settled in nicely and loved the rooftop deck to enjoy sunsets and casual evenings out in fresh air. The walking/bike path along the canal was a block away which took us to Gas Works park for beautiful views of skyline. Tesla supercharger is a mile away near Trader Joe’s. Everything was nicely furnished and stocked so we could focus on enjoying our vacation. Fun place with great hosts!

Tulika and her husband were super awesome and accommodating. Our apartment was very spacious, clean and comfortable. <br/>Super cute set up, kitchen was very modern with all you need to set up shop for your duration! We will be back and telling all our friends and family about Tulika's Hideaway! Cheers!"
17094436,135685901,,11496693,Jennifer,I had my family stay at this lovely garden view retreat and they loved it. The family that hosted us are so kind and accommodating! The space itself was beautifully decorated and full of warmth. My family had everything they needed and felt very comfortable. I would definitely recommend this great place any time! Thanks so much!
39136353,556133039,,115024896,Nathalin,Marissa’s place was just as described. It was great and host communication was fast and helpful. Marissa was a very accommodating host!

22338467,267796386,,115333687,Carol,"Sue's place is amazing - it's just the peaceful retreat that was advertised! You enter the guest apartment through her beautiful garden. You have plenty of space to lounge around both outside and indoors. The bed is one of the most comfortable I have slept in! And Sue has planned every detail out carefully for your stay, with helpful tips and instructions. I couldn't have been happier. This place is a real find!"
9233533,54219390,,11533511,Kim,Our stay at Tina's home was just what we needed. Very comfortable and well stocked with everything one could possibly need. Charming and helpful hosts. Slept like a baby on the memory foam mattress! Would highly recommend this spot to anyone looking in North Seattle.
16690527,138434789,,11557519,Olga,"Kristi's studio was a perfect fit for a city getaway. I was greeted with a warm welcome, and the place itself was cozy, quiet, clean, and has all the essentials. <br/>The parking spot is a big bonus, that way I could leave my car and walk into the University district which is a few minutes walk."
36844733,656778822,,11559,B,"Pro- nicely decorated small spot in a nice area .<br/>Con- I was on staying in that space for a month or so .<br/>Had to move out after two days to let the owner deal with the home infestation issues .Hundreds of ants ,spiders ,bugs, all over .In bed .day and night ..I was bitten all over .skunks at night and raccoon running on the roof making loud noises all night. Could not sleep .left for two days letting the owner deal w the infestation.Came back to a sea of dead and live ants .In bed , bathtub ,in the coffee machine.You could not walk bare foot at the home .The owner said “ This is an urban environment ......that I am not used to ( I am from Chicago...) <br/>Finally I had enough and left for good two weeks earlier .My worst airB@B experience ever ."
54329445,9.93E+17,,115618644,Abigail,"We had a great time here! Lovely home in a beautiful neighborhood. The house is older but well maintained, gets great natural light, and is in a very nice neighborhood where we enjoyed daily walks. Patty is a very friendly, responsive, and approachable host who was fully available throughout our stay. She left a generous assortment of snacks and treats as an arrival gift, which was appreciated. The house was not fully clean when we arrived, but Patty is aware of the issue and we are confident that it will be addressed for future stays. Overall we had a wonderful time and would definitely stay here again!"
27820717,314913879,,11569355,Lesley,"Seyed is a host who truly cares about his guests and does everything he can to ensure their comfort and satisfaction. This room is in a clean, modern, secure, well-maintained Airbnb guest house with generous amenities and beautiful common areas. It would be ideal for a long-term stay, I think, with public transit, convenience store, and coffee shop on the next corner. This particular room is at the front of the house facing a busy main road, however, so be aware that there may be significant traffic noise. It has a large desk, large TV with streaming services, huge closet, and remote-controlled ceiling fan (not shown in photos). Highly recommended!"
24140987,434437342,,11580391,Shawn,"Blue Jay was exactly like the photos and the description of the listing. It was perfect, the thoughtful details, the local tips, the super clean and well thought out amenities made my stay so wonderful! I loved being able to walk to Ballard and enjoy local coffee and yummy eats! I can’t say enough good things about Blue Jay and the wonderful treatment Christina gave me! A must stay!"
17716612,157823579,,115999778,Sara,Beautiful old house that has been tastefully renovated to reserve charm but allow modern comforts. Wish we could have stayed longer.
17388273,135704216,,116422963,Laura,"This place was amazing! So convenient, we went to the Comicon at the convention center and it was a three minute walk. The condo was beautifully decorated and the appliances are all state of the art. Andre and Joel had a very open communication line and was very helpful in answering any questions we might have had. I definitely will be staying either at this location or one ran by them again!"
13831631,89953995,,1166038,Ryan,"Melissa was extremely kind and responsive. The apartment is well-located near UW, which is great!"

37540799,532933130,,116622124,Miao,"This house is absolutely gorgeous - the pictures don't do it justice. Clean and lots of natural light! The furniture and decor are beautiful and great for our group of 8, and the large TV with free Netflix was a nice touch. The kitchen was well equipped with a ton of glasses and dinnerware, and we mostly used the huge countertop though there was a cool foldable dining table provided as well. Having each bedroom on a separate floor gave us lots of privacy and the top floor even had a large private patio with outdoor furniture. The beds were all super comfy, and we all got an amazing night of sleep with the blackout curtains. The best part is the location - so many restaurants and cafes within walking distance even though the street feels private, and we could literally see the Space Needle from the sidewalk. Sherry was super accommodating and communicative, and added nice touches like high-end tea bags and coffee pods. Would definitely come back here again, and highly recommend this gem for anyone wanting the perfect location in Seattle!"
46109127,706777944,,116740214,Luke,"Petra's place was awesome! <br/>If you're wanting to stay in a classic Seattle neighborhood, Queen Anne is a great place to stay. You'll feel like a local walking out along the beautiful tree-lined streets and just down the street you'll see locals going for coffee, food & noshes. <br/>Safe & quiet, this is truly a great way to experience Seattle."
21083795,206507016,,116757841,Xiaodong,"We had really great experience with NJ and Sandy. They were very warm and helpful, answered all the questions we had and made a few great recommendations to nearby attractions. The condo is in central location. The Pike Place is right behind the condo with two blocks walking . Waterfront night view was great to enjoy. The condo is tasteful decorated. Very clean and neat. We would definitely come back if we are back to Seattle!"
20033536,181457178,,116948098,Michael,We couldnt ask for a better host or stay. We were very taken care of from the beginning. Loved the cottage and can't wait to go back
28841487,336777051,,117045230,James,"I had a very accommodating stay with Barbara in her lovely home which ultimately ended up being a 2 week stay. The home is perfect for anyone looking for a clean, quiet, and economical way to stay in the Seattle area, more specifically the Queen Anne district. <br/>When I had arrived the first task was to figure out parking as it can always be a bit tricky depending on where you are in the city. I found it to be quite easy for me to park my larger sized truck in the neighborhood. The street that the unit is on is the typical 1.5 width street which allows for smaller vehicles to fit in where they can. Almost across the street is a school with pullouts mixed throughout the entire block. Some pullouts are reserved for school loading and unloading and are unavailable during school hours. Some pull outs were reserved for traditional longer term parking without a time restriction. I was able to utilize these every day without issue and saw the spots around me about 50% full when i was arriving in the evening and never saw them completely full. <br/>Checking into the rental was super easy due to the programable door. The keycode was provided by Barbara the morning of checkin and I had no issue figuring out the mechanics and operation once I arrived. Once I made it into the house I was able to understand the ""No Shoes"" policy. The house is around 100 years old (completely restored) and has amazing hardwood floors. There is a reason those floors are in that good of condition for this long and I do not have a problem doing my part. <br/>As I came In I was greeted by Barbara and I received a tour of the house. We went over shared spaces where I was shown my access to the kitchen, dining room, and living room. The home follows a progressive mentality in the pursuit of making a difference in the environment so instructions were provided to assist with recycling and composting. A light breakfast was also provided by Barbara so we went over any details so that I would be able to help my self when i got up .<br/>My bedroom was really nice. The locks on the doors were fitting to the period of the house and are glass handled skeleton keyed in which i had never used as I and my possessions had always felt save. The furniture elegantly minimalist with a nice dresser, bed, desk, chair, closet, ect. I had a long period of stay so Barbara and I worked out a Linen cleaning schedule for bath towels and bed sheets. Personal laundry service was also available under Barbara's supervision which would have accommodated me if I had required it. <br/>The bathroom was very nice. Everything worked as intended and enjoyed the hot showers after some of those rainy days. I personally pulled my personal things into my room every day just to help with my clutter of my long term stay but I doubt that is a requirement. <br/>For the atmosphere of my stay I would say that everything was very quiet and accommodating. Barbara and I would have conversation in passing during the mornings and evenings when we saw each other mainly done on my request for tips and tricks about the area or a status on my stay. I maintained somewhat normal operating hours leaving between 7-9am during the week days and arriving between 6-11 in the evenings with no problems what so ever. I took her up on her breakfast a few times, mostly eating her yogurt and fruit, so thank you Barbara for that. :)<br/>Resources in the area that I utilized were the QFC on mercer that was easy to get to with easy parking, the QFC on Queen Ann Blvd, and the food shops surrounding the area. My favorite being Toulouse Petit as it was one of the first restaurants ive been to in the Seattle area when i started coming here. I felt very safe driving (take it slow with the hills in the rain) and walking (I didnt feel unsafe from any other pedestrians). Overall it is a great quiet neighborhood. <br/>I will summarize that my stay which was originally intended for one week ultimately turned into to two due to the proximity from my new job and ease of accommodation. I would recommend this to anyone who is seeking a nice clean quiet setting to enjoy the Seattle area with. This unit is both accommodating for short term stays as well as longer term week+ rentals. I would absolutely stay with Barbara again if the situation required it. I felt safe, comfortable, and it ultimately made my Seattle visit a success. So Thank You Barbara."

17341642,136618326,,117350552,Sudheer,J.J. is an awesome host with helping nature. Apartment is super clean and welcoming with all latest appliances. I had a comfortable home like stay.
48605278,758487961,,117387644,Irelynn,"This is one of the best Air BnBs I have ever stayed at. Hosts are wonderful people! Amazing tips to make our day fun almost every day! This place is by far the best. Beautiful views, amazing restaurants and wonderful home!"
4100009,19986875,,11745750,Jing,"Lara's apartment is full of details: red towels, bed cover, dish matt etc. matches black genuine leather sofa, white kitchen tables equipped with everything you ever wanted, including organic olive oil, salt, a shelf of spicy, wine glasses, and tasty coffee and camomile tea. My favorite part is bathroom - big and with very good toiletries...! Not mention the heating keeps all the space warm and cozy. It's just as convenient as home. The only down side of the flat is that it's not easy to get a cab over the weekend. But we managed to catch our bus. In conclusion, highly recommended."
6168975,35022010,,11756065,Nancy,"Veronica is a terrific host. She was easy to reach and communicate with. The place was just as described, perhaps even better. Super clean and comfortable. We did not cook there, but it looked like there was everything you could possibly need in the kitchen. The area is convenient to the Seattle area. We took the light rail to downtown without any trouble at all. The neighborhood is very quiet, off-street parking a plus, enjoyed some outside time on the roomy deck, and ate at local eateries. Wonderful stay!"
9.11E+17,9.31E+17,,117666312,Chrisiya,"We enjoyed ourselves at Owais downtown studio. Cozy and had all the basics you need, including coffee pods for your morning coffee. The location is good, quick walk to Pikes Place, there was an inexpensive parking lot right down the block where we kept our car. Hosts were great, had a personable touch, gave us an early check in, and checked in with us to see if we needed anything. Can’t go wrong staying here!"
50601476,4.7E+17,,117797713,Kevin,"Tamara's condo is an incredible spot!<br/>The interior is spacious with a living area, lofted bedroom, and great kitchen that comes fully stocked. The balcony should almost be called a patio, as it's huge. It's worth booking here for the views alone. You have a great view of the lake, and will see boats going by, and seaplanes taking off!<br/>The location can't be beat. It's less than a five minute walk to the waterfront where there are shops and restaurants.<br/>Tamara was also very accommodating, and easy to communicate with. Highly recommend booking!"
16133871,135182974,,117846806,Belinda,The place was awesome!
19419602,294182727,,117860600,Brandon,Easily the best Airbnb I have stayed in. I luckily found this place after my other Airbnb was cancelled five days before the trip. I will be staying again in the future and I can’t wait! Everyone coming to Seattle should stay here!
45806467,4.49E+17,,117920925,Thomas,"We had a great time at our long term stay at Jean Paul's place. He was incredibly friendly and accommodating, and we absolutely loved the loft. The location can't be beat as well. It is a short walk to the sculpture garden, Space Needle, and Belltown restaurant area, but just far enough away to be secluded from the late night noise/crowds. I'd recommend it to anyone staying in the area.<br/>As a note, while the loft was ground floor with a street entrance, we always felt safe and didn't have any problems."
32049112,412899546,,118100979,Parth,"Waunda was a great host, definitely didn't feel like she was a first time host. Starting from communication- fast, responsive, detailed and polite, to the place, everything exceeded expectations. The place is a super clean cozy apartment, with good new furnishings , and everything set up meticulously. She had all the amenities needed for a proper Airbnb, and also went the extra mile asking if we needed anything that she may not have provided. It was so kind of her to offer to mail my phone charger to me when I forgot it there. It was a great stay for me and my friends, and I would highly recommend this place and host!"
17585489,144137864,,1182633,Mariko,"Wow! Great place and great location. I spent a few days looking for hotels in Ballard because I was traveling with my Mother and she's a little weary about AirBnb but she loved ""Sara and Barry's"" house. Parking. Close to a supermarket and Main Streets of Ballard but on a quiet street (walking distance to a few craft beers spots too). Ballard is great and so is their house. Clean, comfortable beds, great shower with pressure, safe and secure home, and perfect for a few days, weeks, or months. In the end my Mom joked how she wanted live in their house so she can live in Ballard. I travel for work so time to time it's great to be away from the ""city"" and enjoy smaller communities / areas. Thank you Sara!!! <br/>Ps Hotels in Ballard are not that great or you're spending money for a hip hotel with a communal bathroom, no thank you."
26874520,291298514,,118280037,Shamil,Great price for a great location. We were fortunate to lock this one up last minute. Conveniently located near the Needle and just minutes from Pike Place!
16352541,136967967,,118453372,Merideth,"This place is wonderful! Everything about our stay was comfortable and thoughtful. The parking was easy to access, check-in and check-out was effortless, and the studio itself was incredibly welcoming. Everything was spotless and organized. The kitchen had many useful cooking gadgets and supplies. The coffee bar they have is fantastic! They even provided coffees that they recommended. The Google Dot system was useful as well. The stay was quiet and peaceful, and we were just a few minutes' drive to the U-District and Fremont. I highly recommend this studio!"
20831049,201709423,,11848051,Phyllis,"We had a lovely time. The apartment is sparkling clean and artfully furnished, the courtyard garden is a lovely amenity, and the host is welcoming. This is a very special little place, perfect for spending time in Capitol Hill, and delightful to relax in."
7342445,39848321,,11848793,Brent,"Quick and easy trip down to Seattle thanks to Tracy & Quyen, thanks guys! Place was clean and well appointed for our stay."
6603376,33887490,,11853903,Todd,"Staying in this home was a wonderful experience! The home itself is a beautiful architectural gem with lush views in every direction. The furnishings are all comfortable, hip, and iconic. It was a great experience going to the local produce store and cooking up a delicious meal in a kitchen fit for a chef. We then ate on the peaceful deck overlooking lake views. Analisa was a great host and gave the best advice on making the most of my weekend visit. The home is a great launch pad for enjoying the region but it is so inviting that you may just want to stay home and enjoy the comfort and tranquility."
14716499,156733013,,118681114,Terissa,"The space is beautiful and very clean. The location was perfect for easy access to Freemont, Ballard, and a quick ride to City Center. They really think of everything a traveler will need. I was pleasantly surprised to find the fridge stocked with water (sparkling and flat), snacks, beverages, and even some local brew! A reference guide gives restaurant suggestions and area info. Thanks for a lovely stay."
26599527,292732503,,118835478,Sarah,"The room David rents is very modern and comfortable and has all the basics you need. It is easy to get into the city by public transportation. The neighborhood is quiet, friendly and safe and we liked living in this nice area. David was very friendly and helpful and we really enjoyed the stay in his Airbnb."
17514702,137627120,,118873386,Kristen,"The pictures do not do this place justice. It was nicer than expected. Kid friendly, beautiful location, close to grocery store, very ""homie"". I would recommend this place to anyone! Owner was very responsive and welcoming for our visit."
23060625,256485938,,119287220,Victoria,"We loved how cozy and welcoming the home was, very clean and also very upgraded and stylish! You could not beat the view or how close you are to anything Seattle has to offer! All of the bedding was so comfortable and everything made us feel right at home with everything we would need! We loved our stay and look forward to returning!"

We had our one entrance to the room which suited us perfectly. <br/>Everything was very clean and organized and the train to the city center was just two blocks away. <br/>We recommend any future Seattle guest to stay at Leah's place."
21295100,210927617,,11943546,Courtney,"Amanda’s place is a cute and cozy space in a great location. The Phinney Ridge neighborhood is lovely and her home is close to local restaurants as well as Green Lake. We had some recommendations in Ballard to check out and that area was a quick drive away....Walrus & The Carpenter for dinner and Barnacle for some of the most delicious cocktails we’ve ever had! Definitely felt like we were staying in a convenient, central location. <br/> Amanda’s apartment was super clean and we had a great night sleep. She left towels and toiletries out for us (amazing job on the elephant towel fold btw!! :) ). There was also a really sweet welcome note and pastries and fruit for the morning which was so generous and thoughtful. We loved Seattle and would definitely stay at Amanda’s again!"

18635270,161359735,,119926313,Christoph,Doug was a great host! His home is a fantastic place in a quiet part of Western Seattle. Doug is very proactive about everything and goes above and beyond to make his guests happy. We rented his space for business travel and could not have been happier.
5328449,28739482,,12005389,Theresa,"Amy and Sean are amazing hosts and the space is wonderful: we were working on writing projects and found the space to be a great work space as well as a home-away-from-home base for excursions throughout the city. We were in for several days, and constantly discovering creative touches around the apartment (when you find a Lynda Barry book on the shelf, you know you are in a good place).<br/><br/>We came in on late flights, and were warmly greeted by Amy who had saved a parking space for us, cheerfully showed us around the space and made sure that we were settled in -- fresh flowers throughout the rooms and fresh fruit in the well-appointed kitchen, along with coffee and tea to get us going for an early meeting the following day.<br/><br/>The dining room table invites you to have long conversations over a glass of wine or a meal, and the view is indeed amazing from either of the two balconies. The neighborhood has a lot going on for those looking for good food and/or nightlife, but the apartment itself is very peaceful.<br/><br/>Now looking actively for reasons to return to Seattle!<br/>"

Everything was immaculate, little conveniences that you wouldn’t think of down to little black towels to remove your makeup. <br/>There are two outdoor spaces, the top deck is amazing, plus a direct view of the Space Needle!<br/>Lastly, the host Marie was so incredibly sweet and thoughtful, leaving local chocolates and a card. Amazing, quick communication and so very accommodating. <br/>If you’re wanting to stay in Seattle look no further because this is the spot."

3308979,16619707,,12118051,Leslie,"Our stay at the New Modern House was amazing! A great view from every room on the top two levels. Jill left a wonderful welcome beverage and snack that was appreciated with a delayed arrival. The house was perfect for a family or two families with plenty of separate levels for hanging out. The entire house was clean and well cared for. The ground level had a bedroom and a play room, the main level had a great kitchen with Viking appliances and plenty of space to spread out. The third level had bedrooms; every one with a great view. The fourth level was where I lived. The rooftop deck was perfect for relaxing, and the den area was great for hanging out. Views of the Olympic range were stunning.<br/>Three great parks were from 1 minute to 5 minute walks away. The neighborhood is a mix of historical and newly built homes. Grocery, great eating and shopping were 4 blocks away. Every day I ran from the house, down the secret stairs that line the Queen Anne area (269 steps down), through Kinnear park, and along Elliott Bay. The cats were also perfect hosts. Every recommendation that Jill left was a great find, and was outside of the typical Seattle tourist arena. <br/>Easy access to the bustle of downtown, but great to escape to quiet and safety at the end of the day."
21214526,221198744,,121267493,Lyn,"James’s apartment in Seattle was a perfect studio-base for exploring Washington State.

Great location with lots of shops and restaurants, gas station within walking distance. <br/>I loved the kitchen part. The host provided everything you need ??. The furniture are truly amazing. James and his wife are very very accommodating and I would love to stay again given opportunity. <br/>Thanks again Mr & Mrs. James!! ??"

26259360,318525378,,122087886,Vivian,"Jill and Joel have the cutest little downstairs private loft! They went the extra mile to make their place stand out. There were plenty of toiletries, towels, blankets, and even tea, coffee and snacks! It felt like a deluxe hotel room but at the same time had a very homey feel!"
28443632,339612919,,122105685,Patrick,"This house is in a great location, just a short uber ride from great restaurants and downtown Seattle. It was clean and quiet in a safe neighborhood. I actually did have my own vehicle and I had no trouble finding street parking within a hundred feet. Merly was very responsive from the booking through the end of our visit. I would happily stay again."
42861356,635128345,,122138937,Nick,Place was lovely and wonderful! Had a great time! The host was awesome and helpful! Would recommend anytime
30894545,472034820,,12214315,Roger,great location minus some crazies that can roam around the area. Very close to capital hill via uber/lyft. Next to a bus line that takes you dt or to capital hill.<br/>Great for a couple for long term stays or short term stay friends it's okay. Neighbors are friendly and it's close to some good eats.
34924092,503867783,,122275196,Bianca,This house is open and spacious - great for medium to large groups. The location is beautiful by Volunteer Park. Great overall!
15624292,146821852,,122533381,Alethea,The room I stayed in was very cozy and comfortable. I loved that her house was close to public transportation and easy to find. Lisa communicated very well with me and made sure I had everything I needed.
17767017,141587249,,122681839,Juliana,Very good.
2830174,12324423,,12305253,Reky,"This place is a great deal (beyond expectations!) and Katrina is an amazing host! I booked the room last minute and she was very accommodating. I had a great time hanging out with her. Not only as a host she provided me with ample info about awesome places and activities in Seattle, but also as a person she is very friendly and easy to talk to. Her place is fantastic. Great location, there are so many things to do in the neighborhood and it's very close to downtown. The room is very cozy, clean and well decorated. The bedroom is comfortable too. It also has a nice view of the city and the mountain! I would come back and stay there again :)"
34259570,463118848,,123486585,Rachel,Yaru was a very accommodating host and let us stay till our mid afternoon flight on the day of checkout. The location is perfect in belltown and there was a lot of space in the condo. <br/>The only thing I would call out is the firmness of the second bedroom mattress. It was quite hard so we ended up putting a mattress topper on it to be a bit softer during our stay.
52268987,5.79E+17,,123603735,Mark,Best Host. Great nice house. Great location. Everything was perfect
48502071,770169219,,123751297,Megan,"Anita's home is spacious and clean, with lots of natural light. The bed and couch were comfy, and the neighborhood is pretty quiet but close to downtown. We'd stay again."
17992913,145321112,,123780081,Jason,"Randy was an exceptional host, he let us in and showed us around the house. He then gave us tips on the area. Very clean and well kept.<br/>Highly recommend staying here. Cheers Randy"
4204939,5.26E+17,,123788898,Sandy,Ramnika’s place is so comfy and they made the process so easy and were very accommodating. The neighborhood is charming and within walking distance of several places to grab a bite to eat and whatever else you might want. We only wish we would have been able to stay in Seattle longer. <br/>We would definitely try to stay here again. <br/>Thank you Ramnika!
35831247,506590426,,123806492,H?nh,"Steward and Courtney were so nice. They guided me very carefully before i came. This place look normal from outside but really great inside with 3 clean bedrooms, bathroom, fully equipped kitchen. They put on table a welcome postcard and some nice candies. Not so far from downtown, and have some restaurants, supermarkets around. I really felt like i was at home."
18876264,174712421,,123876072,Judy,"Great location - tons of restaurants nearby and a quick and convenient walk to both the Space Needle campus as well as Pike's Place Market. Unit was spotless, and loved having extra towels and laundry in the unit. We would definitely return!"
12649999,72441556,,12405795,Amanda,"Great apartment to stay.. perfect location, clean, safe, and quiet. We would highly recommend staying here. We had everything we needed and Cate's instructions were very easy to understand. Thanks for a great stay in Seattle!"
52261508,5.18E+17,,12409538,Elena,"I really enjoyed my month in this apartment. Location is great! Short walk to Green Lake park, and not far from downtown, lot of bars and restaurants around. I loved the little coffee shop just across the road ?? <br/>Despite quite busy street and some noise from it, I slept very well because bedroom window is facing opposite way and it was always quiet. Never heard my neighbours either. <br/>The apartment is well equipped and has everything one might need (pretty basic though). Overall it's a great value, I would stay again and definitely recommend!"
15917796,147275717,,124732898,Christina,"We had such a great time staying at Rocky's Carriage house. It was fully equipped with the essentials for a comfortable stay, clean, bright, and well designed. Very walkable to Capitol Hill if you like walking (40-50 mins) and a straight shot on the 70 bus, with a lot of local amenities in the neighbourhood as well. Thanks Rocky!"
21487420,279461093,,124734581,Tara,"An amazing location for girl's weekend. Walk everywhere! Pike's Market is less than two blocks away, the waterfront is less than two blocks (take elevator down to D and go through parking garage). Absolutely stunning views, quiet, clean and Debra was a breeze to work with!<br/>Wonderful amenities to cook in the condo with food we purchased from the market, great table for breakfast or evening board games and the space was furnished perfectly! Starbucks Reserve on the corner is wonderful as is several close restaurants and bars for happy hours and mid afternoon drinks. Would highly recommend Harbor Steps!!"
51563443,4.29E+17,,124763709,Hannah,"This place was genuinely a 10/10 in all aspects! The apartment was spotless and very cozy while also spacious and had all the amenities and supplies you need. Pool/hot tub/rooftop deck AND parking are all an added luxury too! Location is walking distance to everything in Seattle, felt very safe and fun here. The hosts are quick to respond and go out of their way to make sure you have a good experience. Have to make it a point to stay here every time I come to Seattle!"
15164797,149731056,,124767435,Donna,What a wonderful place to stay!!! Tim & Arlene are great hosts. You are close to Alki Beach and easy to connect with freeways and downtown Seattle. We wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.
17992342,144879155,,124772027,Kevin,very comfortable one bedroom apt with everything you could need. location was nice--walking distance to a lot of the goings-on in fremont. randy was very responsive and accommodating with my check-in time and offered many suggestions for things to do during my stay.
51625558,5E+17,,12479815,Indigo,this place is lovely! It's super cozy with nice furniture and the location is perfect next to restaurants grocery store and light rail. there's a great view of the mountains on the little balcony and everything was well stocked. Def recommended!
30535269,418254499,,124809209,Juanfran,"Great place to stay, plenty of space for the whole family. Very clean. Great communication. I will come back."
17825371,166228406,,124877506,Jean,"Great location! This is a very comfortable home for a family staying in the Seattle area. Sabranie was wonderful about communicating with us before, during, and after our stay. Very enjoyable!"
9.17E+17,9.79E+17,,124920138,Amy,Beautiful townhouse that's very functional. There were 3 adults and we stayed for 2 months here working in Seattle. It was nice being able to walk to the grocery store and there's a craft beer spot and a sports bar that we walked to often! The rooftop patio was a nice bonus-enjoyed the views! I loved being so close to Ballard and also close to UW Montlake where we were working. Jacob and Karla were excellent hosts! I would definitely stay here again.
46309611,707930325,,125067127,Weihong,This apartment is very clean and new. Good view to the downtown. Lily is a very nice host and ready to help all the time!
26607432,289207320,,125168171,Caffee,Great host! We had happy stayed there!
226677,698579,,1252047,Michael,"I stayed here as my first stop after moving to Seattle for work. Angielena hosted me for a month, and I couldn't have asked for a better experience staying in a great little neighborhood. <br/><br/>Georgetown is a fascinating area full of arts and lots of activities to enjoy. There are local restaurants and stops worth enjoying, my favorites were Hangar Cafe, All City Coffee and Stellar Pizza. I didn't use the bus much, but it's easy to get downtown that way, and this is also a very car-friendly location. You can get on and off I-5 in less than 3 minutes, or head downtown on some of the other roads. <br/><br/>If you're looking for an isolated spot to relax in complete quiet, this probably isn't for you. If you want a spot that's peaceful even while it's in the middle of the activity, then I can't recommend this enough."
28956135,336727191,,125575725,Stuart,"Great spot in the heart of Seattle. 5 minute walk to the bus stop which will take you downtown in 15 mins. The host was very accommodating and easy to talk to. The place was spacious and clean. No complaints, we will be back!"
26303627,290546423,,126003327,Brian,"What a wonderful place to stay! It’s really close to all the great places in Seattle yet secluded enough to relax and enjoy a bit of nature if you want to. Bret and Rachael were amazing hosts and did everything they could to make our stay memorable and enjoyable. If you like cozy and contemporary accommodations with hosts determined to make you feel at home, this Montlake Home is a great choice. I can’t recommend it highly enough."
36696017,532431830,,126035386,Greg,"Kath & Dave were excellent hosts! They provided great communication and were receptive to questions and feedback. The space was comfortable, clean, and well organized. They have thought of everything to enjoy a relaxing quiet space in a great neighborhood."
17889172,152035722,,126060148,Alex,Had a great time staying at this little apartment with my girlfriend. Perfect for a couple passing through town and a very central location for exploring the city. Randy was a great host. Highly recommend staying here.
5581705,231527852,,126157038,Ben,Responsive host<br/>Off street parking great
8.72E+17,9.86E+17,,126249929,Han,It’s a warm place
17979842,147073076,,126424330,Alison,Good location
30859809,424019899,,126501169,Christopher,"I never really stayed in one rental for a whole month before and never had a shared entry; however, the unit being on the bottom floor meant that I didn't have to walk through the condo to get to my room, when I came back late. Sean was very accommodating and easy to reach, either in person or by the phone, for any questions or requests that I had. If you don't need a big space, this is a steal for it's price and location. I would definitely stay there again."
9.07E+17,9.15E+17,,126603269,Maddy,"Truly enjoyed staying at Lee’s great place! We appreciated how intentional and well done their spot was setup ?? Also, Lee made it very welcoming and convenient checking in / checking out. Next time we’re in the area, I will definitely be on the lookout for this spot. Thank you, Lee!"
18037851,159367635,,126652316,Michael,"First off, anyone who is planning to take the 4 week TEFL/TESOL course in Seattle I Highly Recommend this place for its location. It is very close to where the course is being held. Yen was an awesome host who was very helpful in accommodating me with the crazy schedule I had. While I am not the typical Airbnb traveler, what I needed for my four weeks course was met with this location. The room I had was great and spacious for the materials that I needed. The house did tend to get cold, but it was quickly resolved. So, any student who needs a place to stay for the 4 week intensive TEFL/TESOL course, this is the place to stay."
48933171,3.97E+17,,126672550,Candice,"Stayed for 1 month with .<br/>Pros:<br/>Morgan was easy to communicate with and quick to respond to messages.<br/>Location is ideal for those staying with dogs. Short walk to a walking/biking trail and short drive to a dog park.<br/>Neighborhood is quiet.<br/>Cons:<br/>House construction/demolition was not disclosed before booking. Would definitely ask if construction is ongoing, especially if you plan to stay in during work hours. The walls are insulated but noise travels through the air vents and the door that separates the unit's kitchen and the part of the house that is under construction.<br/>Would recommend running the provided Roomba frequently. During our stay, we noticed a lot of dust (maybe from the construction?). After telling Morgan, they added some air vent filters within a few days.<br/>Many flies and spiders; got rid of ~15 spiders during our stay. Initially the rental did not have window screens installed, so we kept the windows closed. About halfway through our stay as the weather heated up, we asked Morgan and she installed most of the screens within hours; turns out they had screens in the garage... This helped with the flies, but suspect spiders were entering via air vents.<br/>The rental unit is old-ish: random stains on the carpet, paint chipping.<br/>Clarifications/more details of the listing:<br/>* The two bedrooms are separated by a wall with windows, so do not expect full privacy.<br/>* There is no full-sized fridge--only a one-door mini-fridge.<br/>* AC is controlled by host upstairs. Was not an issue for us as the host is reasonable and takes into consideration your temperature preferences."
45376316,705946465,,1268205,Aleksandra,"After a change in life circumstances, i needed a place to stay for a month while i got my bearings. Blueground's apartment was absolutely perfect for that. This clean, modern apartment felt like home for a month. I appreciated the simple, tasteful decor; it didn't feel like i was living in somebody else's house, which would have felt tiring and stressful after a month. Everything worked perfectly, and i had no problems of any kind during my entire stay.<br/>If i gave any constructive criticism at all, it would be that the kitchen seemed to be furnished somewhat oddly. There was no kettle (electric or otherwise), no toaster, and very little cookware. Much of the cabinet space was filled with drinkware of various kinds (alcohol glasses, an ice bucket, a cocktail shaker, espresso cups), leaving almost no space for dry food storage. But this is a very minor complaint, and for someone else -- especially someone younger or more social, when Covid isn't an issue -- this could have been a plus. :)"
15548833,116457435,,1269022,Robert,"Everything was fantastic. Our family of six were visiting Seattle for the funeral of my 93-year-old mother. We needed a 'family' retreat in the city. This wonderful, large, Arts-and-Crafts style house was perfect in every way. Thanks so much, Allison."
6.76E+17,6.81E+17,,127424287,Ana Paula,"The place was amazing, clean and totally what you see in the pictures. Bed was very comfortable. <br/>The host is very nice and always checking everything is fine, very attentive person. <br/>There's grocery stores close in walking distance. A bus stop is close in case you needed public transportation. Or gas station around the corner if you come by car or rented one. Saffrons Grill is a restaurant in walking distance and is great."
24957250,284639138,,127608270,Qirui,"The house is excellent, me and my family are enjoying this stay here, and it is a great choice while travel to Seattle!"
7956337,56897997,,12762254,Marina,"Mehrit and Roco,<br/>My stay at your place has been beyond my expectations. I feel blessed to have been your first guest. I loved the privacy, cute place you have set up here, full of love vibrations. The view and setting is amazing, only 3 minute walk for beautiful vieuw on Lake washington and much more. This place has real hosts, living from the heart and that's what touched me the most, and... Mehrit, i got so inspired by your stories of Ethiopia, you felt like a sister to me. All and only the best for you two. Marina"
30044981,351712187,,127757803,Lin,"This place was wonderful! Clean and modern, a full kitchen, and comfy beds and living space. A great location and hostess!"
20427308,185064347,,127772396,Michael,"Carlos is a great host. We hung out the first night, and got along so well that we ended up going to Salem together to see the solar eclipse.<br/>The property was clean, the bed was big and comfortable, and the fridge was well-stocked with snacks. The house is very close to downtown Seattle by car, and 20-30 minutes away by public transit. I had no problems getting to or from the house by bus or LINK, even late at night. As the description says, this is a bed in the corner of an open studio space, not a private room. I did not have problems with this--the only other guests were in other rooms, and rarely came into the studio space."
16412916,156240009,,127772600,Bradley,It's a beautiful place to stay and the location is pretty much perfect. It was also nice to have somewhere to park my car and leave it for the weekend. Shana makes herself available and easy to get ahold of for any questions.
19824463,182043577,,1279565,Don,Beautiful home with uber comfy cloud like bed in room. Private bath was outstanding. Back porch swing for wine at night. Located in north Seattle but easy access all around for north/south.<br/>Located just blocks away from huge beautiful Lake Washington and outstanding walk/jog/run/bike trail all around lake.<br/>Easy access to outstanding restaurants in the various neighborhoods.<br/>Easy access for awesome hiking on i90 east.
49154057,759741580,,128131627,James,"It cannot be overstated how beautiful this location is. Peaceful, beautiful and the sunsets have to be seen to be believed. You won't regret booking this home to stay in !"
20012986,190274412,,128233858,Lisa,We enjoy the time live at here. Will back again if we visit Seattle next time.
18329286,149752021,,128234622,Joanne,Great place. Will definitely stay there again. Great place great great location
18878479,179069634,,12835809,Jason,Separate 1st floor area with own bathroom. Host was friendly and conversational.

54342961,6.71E+17,,128455568,Joyce,It was very comfortable.
16807494,151440094,,129161886,Roger,Scot's place was so cute and spacious. The loft bedroom was large and full height. It was very tranquil amongst the trees. The guest house is private and we were able to make it our home away from home during renovations in our condo. It was perfect for us.
19386894,162864209,,129173639,Mauricio,"At first glance I was a bit surprised (in a slight negative way). But I have to consider that we got there around midnight, and lights were already off. The next day, everything looked way better.<br/>The place is a bit old, and decoration is a bit unconvetional.<br/>Anyway, Perry is very prestative and communicative. I would stay there again."
41343272,597528019,,129207911,Isabella,"This place was great! It’s in a great spot - walking distance from some quick bites, a grocery store, a gas station convenience store. Not far from the heart of the city.<br/>Very cute and cozy place.<br/>Very happy with our stay and would recommend staying here."
37125115,593354691,,129302793,Clayton,Chistopher is a great host. On time and very helpful

18477502,154931111,,129903982,Renae,"I highly recommend this home for anyone visiting the area. The accommodations were exactly as described and much more. The hosts were great and provided very detailed information through out the process. Thanks for the complimentary bottle of wine, open bar access and bottled water!!"
25110702,278302466,,129904263,Michelle,"We just returned from a fabulous week at Seth’s truly magical home in Queen Anne. The home was spotless, full of beautiful character and situated in a gorgeous quiet neighborhood. We found ourselves saying many times we could move right in!!! And the views...absolutely stunning! Seth was very responsive from inquiries prior to booking to questions during our stay. The neighborhood is safe, very walkable (albeit hilly) and everything you need is a walk or short uber ride away. The bunk beds were a huge hit for my 3 year old daughter...she is still talking about them! We were brave and chose to rely on public transportation during our stay. We found the number 1 bus (a few blocks away) to be very reliable and easy! Whole Foods and Safeway a short uber ride away and cute shops/restaurants a 15 minute walk away. Short uber ride downtown to my work meetings and my family was extremely happy exploring numerous child friendly tourist spots including the children’s museum, aquarium, Chihuly and the zoo. All easy to get to and fun! We loved walking the neighborhood visiting the children’s park, checking out the beautiful homes in the neighborhood, a stop at Macrina’s bakery for some yummy pastries (a must) or ice cream at Molly Moon’s! My family truly enjoyed our stay and Seth was a spectacular host. We felt so at home which made it hard to leave! We hope to return again!"
50136671,9.09E+17,,12993519,Clarisse,We had a great stay. The flat is very nice and the hosts are great !!
797358,21721966,,1299612,Garren & Deirdre,"This was our second stay at Liam's home. That fact speaks to how much we enjoyed it. <br/>Relaxing energy in the home, nice location in the southern side of Seattle which offered plenty of exploring. Relatively close to the light rail as well, which can take you quickly and easily to the heart of the city. <br/>The home was very clean and well appointed as well. <br/>A great area we discovered was Seward park. Very near to Liam's home. <br/>Liam was also a great host to work with. <br/>I would recommend this location to any airBnB travelers."
39467894,579058539,,130062381,Keith,The location is fantastic! Many local restaurants within walking distance. I found the layout and amenities great as well. I would highly recommend this property.
51253116,4.77E+17,,13007454,Emily,"Great spot, highly recommended. It's the main/upper floor of a duplex house, Very comfortable & well-stocked, best towels I've ever had in an AirBnB. We stayed for almost two months and were able to cook meals and do all the other daily-life stuff that places like this aren't always set up for. Great light in the living room, large office with a murphy bed, heated bathroom floors, little balcony & yard for nicer weather, straightforward street & driveway parking. Easy to walk to the U District and downtown Wallingford, both of which have great farmers' markets & restaurants. Short walk to two coffee shops on 56th St (Hiroki was my favorite). Rowland was easy to reach when we needed to. Two main drawbacks: Neither the house nor the neighborhood is handicapped accessible - there are steps up to the apartment, and a steep hill to walk anywhere east. Also it's right on I5. Very convenient for driving, since the on/off ramps are right there, but you are contending with some highway noise. We found that we slept fine with earplugs on and the bedroom windows closed."
24395100,259298095,,130243844,Fiona,great view and very convenit !
202251,16277472,,13024520,Hilda,Tim is a fast-respond owner and very nice to offer help before chech-in. I feel sorry that we could not live in the house finally due to our arrangement. I do appreciate Tim's understanding.

35807042,520635280,,130852928,Xochitl,"Lynn’s place was absolutely perfect! The small surprises we walked into were perfect to start our trip, from snacks to coffee additions we had everything ready for us when we checked in. Please do make an effort to get to know Lynn, she’ll give you all the insider tips and locations that are must sees. The warm and friendly welcoming we were given truly made our stay feel like we were at home. Will definitely book again ??"
12835141,81861022,,13096334,Jesse,"Fifi was an excellent host. She was very accommodating, responsive, and welcoming. The room is cozy and quiet with all the amenities one could need. The room has amazing views of the Seattle skyline too. The courtyard is located within easy walking distance of the U District and Fremont neighborhoods wherein you'll find plenty of great restaurants, grocery stores, and entertainment venues. I stayed here for nearly 3 weeks and would do so again! Highly recommended!"
24286056,267481535,,131110523,Ryan,"I can not recommend the Oasis enough! The location was perfect for our trip, centrally located within walking distance to all of the major sights while also delivering a quit reprieve away from the crowds. The apartment itself is a great space, clean and comfortable with a large bathroom with great lighting! But our favorite feature was without a doubt the incredible roof deck which offers sweeping views of the city skyline and the space needle! Deirdre could not have been a better host either. It was our first trip to Seattle and Deirdre was more than generous in providing us with local tips and suggestions for the area that only enhanced what was already a great trip! Would gladly stay here again when in Seattle!"

43047552,720227503,,131310354,Ranae,Be sure to visit the park that is just a block away and the Mountains to Sound trail that leads off from that park. It's a great benefit of this home.

52735199,7.94E+17,,131693801,Editt,"We had a great stay at this Airbnb and Emily was a very responsive and nice host! The space is very cute and location is great for exploring Ballard and Seattle. We are local to Seattle and stayed for 1 week while our condo was getting remodeled. Everything was pretty clean and we felt right at home. There is a parking spot available in front of the home as well which was very nice. The only downsides to the space is that the kitchenette is pretty small with a small fridge so that wasn’t ideal for a 1 week stay, but it wasn’t too big of a problem since we mostly ate out and explored Ballard. Another downside is that the door of the bathroom is a barn door style, so, although it does lock, the side of it is a little separated from the wall so you can end up seeing through the side. Overall though great space and Airbnb experience!"

2522091,11233109,,13170238,Danny,"My stay at the casa on alki was wonderful! Not only does it boast one of the most impressive views of the Sound and the Olympic Mountains but the lovely patio and fascinating glass wind sculpture capture the whimsical nature of a true vacation in the best possible way.<br/>My girlfriend and I enjoyed the spacious and lovely apartment with it's fresh furnishings, large kitchen island (with everything you would ever need) tasteful art and comfy couches. <br/>The bed was great, the bathroom was clean and also wonderfully decorated. Shells, sea stars, as if you needed to be reminded that you were in a northwest paradise. <br/>Privacy is a big thing for me and this place was perfectly private. Close to everything Alki and west seattle has to offer, not to mention a ten minute drive into seattle itself across the bridge, but nestled on a bluff in a posh, quiet neighborhood the whole experience exudes 'getawayfromitall' vibes. <br/>I would stay there again and again and seriously cannot wait until my schedule permits me too. <br/>If you are looking for a romantic getaway, a writer's retreat, or simply want to toss your cares into the ocean and relax with a warm cup of fresh coffee, than by all means look no further than this amazing place. Contact Michelle, she is sweet, easy to work with and also a great gardener as you will see from her beautiful landscaping. <br/>Enjoy your vacation!<br/><br/>Danny and Carolyn."

5337848,28322363,,131977,Marcus,"Manlio & Gayil warmly welcomed us into their lovely cottage guest house, and their adorable children brought us some of Gayil's delicious, freshly baked treats during our stay ;-). The Vecchiets were gracious hosts, and their cottage is a hidden gem! <br/>The cottage is full of natural light and very airy with high ceilings, a refreshing open concept kitchen/living space, and lovely french doors leading out to a canopied balcony. Both the bedroom & bathroom are quite spacious and very relaxing with subtle pops of color & tasteful decor. <br/>We enjoyed a wonderful stay at the Vecchiet cottage!! We would highly recommend their refreshing cottage retreat to anyone needing a staycation or visiting Seattle.<br/>"

9534,862700,,1323033,Amy,We had a great stay at the Tangerine Dream. It is a great place to stay in West Seattle - close to everything. The house is comfortable and spacious even though it is a bottom floor unit. The utensils and pots/pans for use are better than most of the timeshares we have stayed at. Cassie makes sure that you have everything you need and you definitely feel welcome.

35162967,471550406,,132892219,Arianna,Thank you so much Mariko and Ted. The place was better than Id expected and the view was spectacular. The beds and the pillows were extremely comfertable. The living area as well as the back yard were the best places to spend time. Whoever your interior designer was for the living/dining area did an awesome job. I fell in love with your sectional... So big and cozy. The next time we take a trip to Seattle I hope your place will be available as I definitely look forward to revisiting. THANK YOU THANK YOU! Definitly Super Host worthy.
36480820,492856971,,132962912,Christian,"When we first stumbled upon this flat on AirBnB, it seemed almost too good to be true. There must be a catch! But everything was as perfect as it seemed online (The Apartment is even nicer in real than on the photos). Sandy is the most thoughtful, gracious host and a great, heartful person. We were her first guest. ??<br/>Sandy provided us with all the information we needed and showed us around. The flat is just perfect! The Kitchen is compact and contains everything one needs. Sandy filled up the Fridge with Water, Soda and cooking basics, which was just great after our 12h drive from Yellowstone. <br/>The bed is super comfortable, bathroom and terrace are excellent. Location is incredible. Free parking in front of the door, quite during day/night and easy access to downtown via bus.<br/>Sandy had excellent restaurant recommendations and was of great help. She went way beyond to make our stay comfortable and memorable.<br/>This was one of the best AirBnBs we have stayed in our 2 Month USA journey and we would recommend it to ANYONE. <br/>Thank you, Sandy and Seattle, for having a great end of our world trip!"
43802203,634357082,,133033434,Anthony,Perfect location to explore Seattle! The area is really nice and walkable. We will definitely be back!
48279255,743839235,,1331150,Keavy,"Every morning between 4am-6am garbage trucks park in the alley next to the building and load heavy garbage into their flat beds. This lasts for hours and because the alley is in between two buildings the sound travels very well and is extremely loud. I had to sleep with earplugs in and it still didn't muffle the sound. <br/>Even though I paid for a parking space, and was told the key would be left in the room, the key wasn't there when I arrived and it took over a week to actually get a key. This meant daily calls to the Kinect customer service, calls to Blueground (who seemed to have no clue what was going on), and having to call the concierge everytime my car needed to go in and out of the garage. I did this multiple times a day for a whole week. <br/>I then discovered that the washing machine in the room had not been installed before my stay. This meant coordinating again with the kinect group and blueground to try to get someone to come in and fix it. After much back and forth it turned out that the machine was broken which meant that they needed to install a new one. This meant that I had a repair man in the apartment with me for multiple days of my stay."
3273014,14531812,,13316614,Dana,"Quick communication, great space, very convenient. Clean, convenient. WIFI was slow, not business speed at all. Accessible parking and laundry was great. Kitchen was great. Seemed like a sketchy neighborhood, but was fine."
19059339,160354578,,133275960,Amy,"Robert is very easy to work with. When we encountered an issue during our stay, he responded promptly to remedy it.

18156698,158463822,,133280565,Doug,Had a wonderful stay – great accommodations and the hosts were very friendly. And the view was fantastic – very relaxing. I highly recommend this place.
24067084,305692439,,133306736,Dwaine,"The house worked out very well for us. We had six in our group. The location to everything we wanted to do and see was excellent. Very close to downtown Seattle, Pikes market, city center, etc. The house is in an older area but the entire area seems to be rebuilding. We never had an issue with the street parking and getting a space in front of the house. We would definitely consider staying again if in the area. We had a few minor issues which Amy addressed immediately. She was an excellent host and great with communication on any questions and issues."

42786661,664684150,,133604954,Krissy,"Gian’s driftwood cottage is the perfect Seattle spot! I was here visiting friends and seeing the area and this location made it easier to get around for sure . Gian is a very down to earth person, super helpful with anything and reply’s fast . The cottage was so comfortable and cozy it also had nice “home-y” touches and was a great private space. This place was very convenient, very clean and also the backyard makes a great hang out spot especially at night with the lights on. The neighborhood is wonderful, very quiet and friendly neighbors. It was perfectly what I needed and I thoroughly enjoyed my stay. I recommend Gians driftwood cottage."
21914270,228647118,,133609289,LaDonna,"Beautiful tiny home in a safe quiet neighborhood with easy access to groceries, restaraunts, shopping & down town Seattle. Karen was accommodating, helpful and easily accessible."
21043382,334994950,,133707236,Nicole & Scott,"We had the absolute pleasure and honor of being Rose and Glens first air bnb guests on this particular location! <br/>That it's the keyword! LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION!! you are minutes from ""Seattle center"" which is home to many museums and the iconic space needle! I recommend getting an uber which was $5-$10 depending on time of day. <br/>We were visiting our son who resides in Seattle's oldest communities, Queen Ann, again only a 10 min drive. <br/>Rose and Glen were a delight to communicate with! We also had the pleasure of meeting Patsy who welcomed us on Rose and Glen's behalf. <br/>The bed was super comfortable! The view of the city at night was spectacular! The deck area has the most wonderful ambience added with the lighting the host chose. Despite cool evenings, I bundled in some sweats and a blanket and enjoyed beverages, good conversation and a movie :) <br/>There are two refrigerators, one in the kitchen area and one on the deck to conveniently housed our beverages. <br/>The wifi worked well and was creatively displayed for our convenience. <br/>The TV came in handy to watch and relax on a slow rainy morning or late in the evening. <br/>Hangers left in multiple closets were convenient along with ample storage. I'd recommend not utilizing the drawers out of respect for the age of the boat. <br/>Some things to keep in mind if you've never stayed on a boat (we were avid boaters so I knew what to expect)...<br/>This is close quarters. you will walk single file in the master bedroom. <br/>The master bathroom and shower are small, one person at a time. <br/>The head (toilet) and shower are not like the ones at home and can not be treated as such. We found purchasing wipes to utilize in place of the toilet paper was helpful and easier to throw away. Rose and Glen left fantastic instructions! <br/>This is a mid century boat adorned with wood and mid century beauty, which also has a marine odor, not a negative odor, but if you're sensitive, you will notice. For me it brings back memories :)<br/>You are next to a swim school, so you'll have passerbys, we enjoyed seeing the little ones! <br/>China Harbor hosts wedding receptions and such, so on Friday and Saturday we got to listen to the DJ and watch the lights dance off Lake Union :) When we retreated into the cabin, the noise was greatly diminished. We're heavy sleepers and night owls so this didn't bother us. <br/>This is an absolute Gem with beautiful views at a fraction of the price you'll pay to stay in this area! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay!"
35007118,526918210,,133787761,Josh,"Couldn’t ask for a better first experience with Airbnb! Amanda and Jeremy are amazing hosts and the unit is fantastic! They went out of their way to accommodate me and my motorcycle. Super friendly, Jeremy also rides so we chatted for a good while and he gave me lots of tips and suggestions for places to go and routes to ride. He also had plenty of suggestions for places to see and go around the city. <br/>The space is very nice and more then adequate for my needs. It has a fantastic view overlooking the Sound. The bed was very comfortable and the all the linens were clean. The shower was nice, clean and the water hot. They had very nice smelling shampoo, conditioner and body wash available for your use as well. There’s a coffee pot, microwave, refrigerator and plates and utensils for you to use if you need. <br/>The space is great and the hosts even better! I wouldn’t hesitate to stay here again (in fact I hope to when I find myself in Seattle next)."
27342729,329805983,,13379536,Matt,"We were delighted to be Anthony and Eva's first Air B&B guests. Comfortable and well-appointed studio. It's very simple, but it's got everything you need to sustain you during your stay. The neighborhood is gorgeous and delightful to walk. Close to some great dining and entertainment amenities on Queen Anne Avenue. Downtown is even walkable if you're an adventurous urban hiker! Pro-tip: check out Targy's for a super low-key, totally authentic neighborhood watering hole."
9823290,56225772,,13392445,Jeanne,"This was exceptionally clean and well appointed room - everything i needed was available.

She was so accommodating and went out of her way to provide anything I needed. Parking was easy to find and the neighborhood is serene and quiet. Nafisa’s home is very beautiful, with lots of space to lounge in and outdoors. There’s also a full kitchen available, which is a great perk. The room is very chic, with lots of closet space. And the bed was super comfy! Highly recommend staying in Nafisa’s home!"
20141183,190979054,,134130608,Zack,"We had an amazing stay with our hosts Ken & Patti. Their house is located by many supermarkets and restaurants. The neighborhood is very quiet and clean. When my brother and I arrived, Ken & Patti greeted us and showed us our room. The room was amazing. It has a private bathroom and entrance. The room has patio that can be used as an entrance. Ken & Patti gave us alot of free snacks. I really appreciated the quality shampoo. The room is far better than a hotel. Ken & Patti answered all our questions. They even suggested places to visit. The overall stay was very positive and relaxing."

53507662,6.17E+17,,134340598,Amber,"For very short term stats (think, less than 5 days) where no communication is required of the Blueground team, and you have no packages planned on getting shipped, I think this spot might be okay. Beyond that, I wouldn’t recommend. <br/>The space is what we expected and the location is very central. I had thought it would be a fun, walkable spot, but all the neighborhoods I preferred (cap hill / Fremont) were just enough out of the way that it required driving and parking, which I didn’t love (I wanted it to be walkable). You’re in the Amazon neighborhood which means you have access to lots of lunch spots/ restaurants, but they are primarily grab and go, so it’s less of an area where I would choose to hangout, personally.<br/>Listing some of the issues we had while staying in this apartment, below.<br/>1. The reaction to the robbery that took place at the apartment was UNDERWHELMING at best. The front desk located my package (which was torn open in the locker room) and shrugged saying “we don’t have a camera and aren’t liable, talk to blueground” then when speaking with multiple people on the BG team about said situation and being told I’d receive a call from management, never received one. When I asked about it again, the team suggested that I call in - which I did numerous times to a phone number which said it was “disconnected”. <br/>On top of that, packages continued to be left in the hallway and there were NUMEROUS times where I saw packages ripped open. Just the overall lack of care of the tenants was disgraceful.<br/>2. Because of the above, I mailed future packages (besides paper towels or things which I hoped wouldn’t be stolen) to the Amazon lockers in the area.<br/>3. Communication - Not only were phone lines disconnected 50% of the time that I tried calling and Airbnb messages delayed to responses in about a day and a half most of the time. (I get that we’re in a pandemic so am understanding of this, but it did make it tricky when my grocery delivery got put in a locker and I had no way to access it and wasn’t sure if I had any way to reach BG.) <br/>We asked before arrival what toiletries would be on hand and were told “toilet paper/ paper towels/ garbage bags… to last about a week”. We knew we’d need to buy these things eventually which wasn’t a big deal, but when we arrived we realized that they were missing. Again, wouldn’t have been that big of a deal, but we had one item break when traveling and had no trash bags or paper towels to help. I then called BG who sent house keeping, who brought us coffee, laundry detergent, and dish washing detergent - all of which we didn’t need and ended up having to stuff under the kitchen sink. It was definitely a face palm experience, but we chalked it up to miscommunication amongst BG and housekeeping and tried to remember that they did ATTEMPT to help.<br/>Now again we’re experiencing the same disconnect BG saying “no upcharges for your ESA animal” before we moved in, and, of course, now we’re seeing an upcharge after moving out.<br/>4. The location was OK, and the place was what I expected. Would’ve probably gotten a 4 star review from me had it not been for the communication (or rather LACK of communication from management) and nickel-and-dime-ing from the team (who is currently trying to charge $500+ more in cleaning expenses, 2 weeks following our stay). <br/>It appears that the only people who actually care about the guest experience is the front line customer service folks. Although they often didn’t answer our questions, they at least tried and did call me back at least once, and I’m grateful for that."
51867680,5.93E+17,,134706400,Jessica,"My partner and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The location is ideal. It’s the perfect spot to start your exploration of the city, as you’re never too far from delicious restaurants or landmarks. The access to the parking garage is very cool, as the side of a wall in the alley of the condo complex opens up to allow access. James Bond vibes. The view from the rooftop was astounding, especially at night. The condo itself was very cozy and clean, with all new appliances. We had excellent communication with the owners and they couldn’t have been more accommodating. It was our ideal getaway as first time visitors of Seattle, and will assuredly be returning. 10/10, cannot recommend enough"
723723,2626906,,1351548,Andrea,"Rachelle and Bernard were fantastic hosts, very warm and inviting. Their suite is clean and comfortable and the goodies they stocked in the fridge was a really lovely touch! They are super responsive by email and the check in process was very smooth. For a quiet and calm stay in Seattle this is a great choice!"

Sean was quick to reply to questions and made the entire 3night stay smooth and very easy. The accomodations were clean, organized and well-kept. The washroom is small and if you're 6ft+ you may have trouble using the toilet and shower."

10252909,308083068,,135864275,Edson,The apartment is in a quiet and nice neighborhood. You can reach Downtown Seattle in 15 minutes by foot or 5 by transit. Allyson is a great host and we loved staying with her. The room and bathroom were clean and spacious. We would definitely stay here again!
1146966,5025109,,1358786,Justin,Ann was a great host who was very kind and welcoming. Not only did Ann do everything she could to make sure we were comfortable but she even went out of her way to put chocolate bars on our pillows! If you are visiting the Seattle area I highly recommend staying with her.
48412542,8.77E+17,,135922073,Tessa,For the location and lack of parking the price is a little steep. There is a public health clinic next door and in the 4 months I was there multiple fights outside as well as homeless moving into the alleys surrounding this building. This made having to park in an adjacent building and walking at odd hours extremely uncomfortable. I had a continued noise problem with the upstairs neighbor that management was aware of but never resolved. I loved the building and everything is had to offer but for the price and location it is not worth it in my opinion.
48071350,736140947,,135954245,Ai,"We enjoyed our stay at Sudha’s house. Great location, easy street parking, clean, modern, comfortable and an amazing rooftop patio. Check-in & out were a breeze. Would highly recommend."
365550,1038264,,1360820,Sabrina,"The Loft is beautiful and centrally located. Even though we only stayed one night I would highly recommend staying at Jaq's and Dirk's place. They have a guidebook with recommendations on food and coffee. Being a coffee addict, the advice to go to Zeitgeist was on the mark!"
35546534,482632522,,136125539,Andrew,The home is in a perfect location with plenty of public parking along the street. The overall presentation of the residence was beyond spectacular. Everything was clean and tidy. Esther herself was very friendly she met with us when we arrived and provided suggestions on activities while we were in Seattle. All said and done. We underpaid for the service we received!! <br/>Without a doubt I will be prioritizing Esther's home EVERY time I stay in Seattle. We were more than satisfied with the whole experience.
52064588,6.47E+17,,136202734,Cyrena,Great place to stay. Can’t beat the location! Very accurate pictures and descriptions. The kitchen is loaded with equipment and gadgets. Comfortable and quiet place to stay in Seattle!
19223154,179112884,,136505724,Derek,"I highly recommend this unit. Quiet, comfortable and close to the city and a walking trail. And it was the only Air BnB in the price range with its own bathroom.The host, Micky was really great, and made my stay very personal, like I was visiting a family member. If you're visiting the Seattle area, this is one of the best."
45993748,711975542,,13669439,Matthew,"This is a great value for all the amenities and the perfect location on Capitol Hill, just a stone's throw from food and beverage options, a grocery store and much more. Elliott was a gracious host with excellent communication and the space is really spacious and clean. Although they list it as a one bedroom, there is an extra sleeping space that offers a much larger apartment than I imagined. I didn't have a car, but the parking space would be very helpful. I'd definitely stay here again."

She is friendly, accessible and it's easy to sense that Jessica really values bringing people together as a community. <br/><br/>The apartment itself was newly renovated, spacious and comfortable. I couldn't get in enough time cooking in the awesome kitchen! The garden is beautiful and it was great to have the opportunity to get my hands dirty and participate in maintaining the space.<br/><br/>South Seattle is a special place and Jessica can point you in the right direction of places to eat, connect with others, exercise and adventure. <br/><br/>Thanks for a great stay and we might be back!"
34982508,458934456,,137811538,Alexa,"Decent room, not the cleanest furniture (desk and chair had dirt and seemed to be secondhand which is normally fine but in this case, was somewhat dirty); however, house seems to be newly remodeled. <br/>Make sure you change the sheets before you sleep (at the time of writing, it’s currently an optional do-it-yourself at the end of your stay). <br/>(Shared) Bathroom door currently doesn’t close but host was alerted so hopefully it will be fixed soon. <br/>Close to downtown Seattle though! Like 10-ish minutes downtown by car. Very close to Zoo too."

39728889,572447012,,1382357,Kevin,"My family and I (2 small boys and 3 adults) stayed in Jonathan's home for 5 days during Thanksgiving while touring around Seattle. We have a wonderful stay, in no small part to this cozy home. The place is spotless and seems brand new. Literally most of the furniture, bedding, cookware, etc. was brand new. Jonathan was even gracious and thoughtful enough to have a pack-n-play and lots of toys/books around for my kiddos to enjoy--a huge bonus! A few thoughts on this home:<br/>Things We Liked:<br/>- Clean, spotless, and tastefully decorated<br/>- Fast Wi-Fi<br/>- Location, location, location: close to everything!<br/>- Well-appointed with the essential amenities (laundry, cooking basics, etc.)<br/>- Comfy linens and blankets<br/>Things We Wished We Knew Ahead:<br/>- The mattresses, while new, are on the soft side (I definitely prefer firm beds), so I ended up sleeping on the futon (which was fine). Keep this in mind if you need a firm bed for a good night's sleep.<br/>- The entire house is hardwood floors, which all the things that come with them: creaky upstairs and slippery floors (my toddler slipped and hit his head--nothing serious!)<br/>- The kitchen, while new, is very spartan and basic. Definitely not the kind to cook a masterful Thanksgiving meal or heavy-duty cooking (just salt, pepper & oil)<br/>In all, we had a wonderful time and would definitely recommend this place for couples and families alike. Thanks Jonathan!"
41599161,602109468,,13832722,Sean,Very clean and spacious home. A short walk to the local tram station that takes you to downtown Seattle
10292753,61839912,,13836189,Joss,"Great location. Bright and clean studio, easy access to everything. Great stay!"
16650261,213549010,,138377992,Pa,Naomi was very accommodating with our special needs and very nice. Charming apartment in an old building. Very well located near the train and in the middle of so many great restaurants and places. We walked from the apartment our whole time! Great host with a clean and comfortable apartment.
17011270,137841134,,13866512,Heather,"Clara and Jill host a wonderful place in Queen Anne near many Seattle attractions. The space is very new and modern! Biggest perks are the included WiFi and Parking. I was also allowed to have my cat stay with me. Overall, I would recommend this place to new travelers to Seattle wanting a more inviting space than a hotel."
19274366,214351333,,13874463,Alexander,Excellent place to stay!
15929975,172407372,,1388669,John,The quality and comfort of a Westin hotel with the attentiveness and personal touch of a bed-n-breakfast made for an incredible stay. Its one of the best Airbnb experiences I've ever had.
2614238,13214710,,13896078,Duane,"Kelly and Bryan were gracious hosts and their one-bedroom unit overlooking Lake Washington was a nice break from the city. <br/><br/>Mine was an in-city stay while my own apartment was being worked on. So I needed a comfortable base of operations while I continued to go about my life. The Leschi neighborhood afforded me the opportunity to go for a quick run after coming home and a leisurely walk after dinner. And in the evening I very much enjoyed reading and sipping tea/wine while watching (and not being in) the traffic on the Mercer Island Bridge.<br/><br/>Would I recommend a stay? Yes!"
40805092,635563332,,139120953,Feven,Nice place. Very good area close to everything.
21501950,209737930,,13927460,Loren,This was clearly owned by a company that buys properties and rents them in Airbnb. I think that ruins the spirit of Airbnb. Place was fine. Renter was nice. But basically a hotel at the point.
49246564,754364352,,139306013,Tamika,"Pretty spacious. You have to park on the street, but there is rarely parking on the street available. Ants were in the kitchen along with ant traps (which is wish I would have known ahead of time). There is a downstairs neighbor who is SUPER NICE, but unfortunately their bedroom is right underneath the living room, so you have to make sure not to walk heavy. It’s still a good place to stay. Nice kitchen with lots of dishes and cookware."
51665509,5.3E+17,,13932555,Tye,We enjoyed our stay at Andrea's property. The place was clean and parking was super easy. We experienced a slight hiccup at checkout where the electronic lock stopped working but it wasn't a big deal because we were already moved out. This place lived up to its expectations and we appreciated the responsive communication.
2692126,17264785,,13933599,Cheryl,"I have loved living here. Kelly is really friendly and helpful. When I first arrived, she was welcoming and explained where everything was and gave me all the details about the house. She is easily accessible through text and responds quickly. She's also very respectful and gives me my privacy.<br/><br/>The house is older, but recently renovated and all of the furnishings are nice. Basically anything that you need is already here. There's laundry in the house, which is convenient. The house is pretty quiet in general. There's a separate entrance to the garden unit, so I feel like I have my own space, but it's nice to have other people in the house as well.<br/><br/>I really like the location. The neighborhood feels safe - I have no problems walking around by myself at night. It's also easy to get downtown and to other neighborhoods, like Fremont, which is where I work. It's fairly quiet here. It's nice to be in a convenient location, but not to feel like I'm living in the middle of the busy city. There's a grocery store about half a mile away and just beyond that is the Space Needle. Lake Union is just a short walk away as well."
226536,715263,,1394729,Willa,Cheryl was a wonderful host and helped us feel right at home. She was very helpful in suggesting restaurants for us as well. Her cozy spot was exactly what we needed for a peaceful getaway.
53675251,5.51E+17,,139680612,Kjell,"Randi and Andrew are wonderful hosts. My stay in their home was very comfortable and the house is just around the corner of the main street with many restaurants, bars and shops. Hope to be back soon and would recommend anyone to stay in this stylish and clean townhouse."
1935439,14557300,,13970389,Xixi,"Tim is the person who has a very healthy life! He grows a lot of strawberries, rasberries in the garden that I can enjoy. He drives, also ride bikes to work. He helped me find the bus routes, found the best dye for me, showed me his healthy food. We always have a good talk. As for the house, I can find everything I need in the kitchen. My room in the first floor has a private bathroom, which is so convenient. Wifi is everywhere. QFC is just in 2 min walk! I really enjoy staying here!"
17575412,175398693,,139763576,Renee,"This is a wonderful retreat. The place is immuculate and the attention to detail in design is incredible. It is an extremely comfortable space where my family of five had an amazing stay. Jeff is very warm, welcoming and informative and helped to make our stay there spectacular."
9.1E+17,9.18E+17,,139941125,Michele,This apartment is very convenient to the university area and is basic accommodation. It has everything needed and was reasonably comfortable. It was very clean. The photos in the listing are accurate.
19699462,172069023,,139947945,Kelly,"Kathryn and Tom's place is a lovely little basement suite located within 15 minutes driving distance to downtown Seattle. It has its own private entrance, was clean and cozy and had all the needed amenities. Kathryn and Tom were wonderful at staying in touch--making sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed. I would definitely stay here again."
35125287,617776656,,140033904,Jeremiah,Very clean place with a friendly host. Everything that was needed was there!
53107692,5.02E+17,,140087827,Alejandra,Great location!! Very easy to get around since you are less than 10 mins (driving) from downtown. Very clean and cute studio.
31861313,406236093,,140158194,Jennalee,We absolutely loved our stay at the Beach themed home! So much thought out into every detail! Super comfy & inviting! We would definitely stay here again! Rebecca & her husband were so accommodating & very kind. If you are looking around & are considering this home as an option I would recommend renting it for sure! You won’t be disappointed one bit!
49275438,754823341,,14016279,Yeseul,"It was our last min decision to change to airbnb to stay closer as a big group. Honestly I was abit worried that there are not many reviews for the place, which turned out to be an unnecessary concern. The place was stylish, clean, spacious, and very accommodating. We cooked and ate together, spent all night playing board games in living room, and went on hiking to shake off some weights we put on. It was perfect weekend getaway! Eva was professional and make us feel very welcomed in her place. She gave us good recommendations about the things to do in the area, which all of us took a full advantage of :) I hope this place won’t get too popular though- so that I can book again when I come back ?? Thank you Eva for your hospitality!"
45481895,717905933,,14018688,Alexander,Great location and FANTASTIC SPACE! I would recommend this spot to anyone looking to stay in Seattle.
18196871,176370298,,140207458,Abdi,"Really enjoyed my stay at Megan's space. She's an amazing host who went over and above to make sure my stay was excellent. I would definitely look into staying with her again if I'm in the area. My favourite part of the unit is the backyard it was breathtaking and really relaxing when we were hanging out, it had the perfect vibe"
28787210,337305936,,140272052,Caitlin,"This is a cute little home that is close to downtown. Everything was clean and tidy upon arrival and contained all of the amenities you might need. Small, thoughtful touches were left everywhere (shampoo, toothpaste, etc.) in case you forgot to pack something. Floor to ceiling windows in the bedroom showed off a rustic, woodsy backyard that is a refreshing change from the city views. <br/>There was space to park a car and we found that getting around Seattle by car (during non-rush hour times) was not as bad as expected. Alternatively, downtown Seattle is just a short Uber/Lyft ride away.<br/>Supriya was friendly and incredibly responsive before and during our stay. She even left us some personal suggestions for local places to visit!<br/>Highly recommend! Will be visiting again!"
19594064,172090082,,140638610,Ryan,"Max was very welcoming, had a nice place. Definitely would stay again if I'm ever in town"

23770520,255817292,,140742472,Meagan,Stayed here for an event with my terminally ill daughter. The place was very cozy and quaint. we would have stayed an extra night if it hadn’t been rented again because it was so enjoyable.
7.47E+17,8.35E+17,,141042472,Rodrigo,"Stayed here one night. Overall it was a great experience. The apartment was very clean with new furniture and bedding. The host was very responsive and friendly. Instructions were clear and check in was easy. Apartment felt homie, location was great with easy access to highway and downtown Seattle. Would stay again!"
2578855,11731732,,14105294,Abby,Stephanie is amazingly sweet and the space is beautiful and cozy. It is a few blocks from Green Lake which is a 3 mile run (3.5 from the house). <br/>Stephanie was very thoughtful and went out of her way to make sure that I would be taken care if. Great stay!
19493891,173700844,,141225775,Samantha,Perry was a wonderful host. He responded to any messages in a very timely manner and was very insightful. His home was clean and very reasonably priced.
19316928,180241711,,141241612,B,"This is a lovely home in a very nice neighborhood. We had everything we needed and plenty of room to spread out in the house. It was a great place to stay in Seattle, and we were able to get to our destinations without much effort or drive time at all. I would highly recommend it for your visit to Seattle, and we would definitely stay here again."
49692093,7.09E+17,,141442365,Laura,Quiet spot and pristine!
19626395,173732459,,141531194,Boris,"This is a great place for those who want a NEW (at least new-looking), spotless, clutter-free experience that feels VERY private (you can't even see the front door from the street, so the unit has a ""hidden"" feel). The apartment is 3 floors (you enter into the TV area, which leads to the kitchen; we liked that the master + 1 other bedroom was upstairs and a separate bedroom downstairs, which allowed everyone to have their own quiet time too). The owner, Bryan, genuinely cared about us being comfortable in his home, down to the smallest detail like how to use the washing machine (a big deal for travelers who are apartment dwellers without their own W/D and don't want to figure out these things) to the nearest discerning latte (also a big deal for coffee snobs like us, which btw is Caffe Vita 2 short walking blocks away). Nice that all the furniture, including beds, actually SMELLS new, which makes you feel like you're one of the 1st ppl in there -- we actually asked what mattress brand was in the Master because it was so luxuriously comfy. Coming from a big city I appreciated that windows in every room made the unit feel breezy; we just left them open all the time (combination of the private/back/hidden location of the unit + safe 'hood made this feel perfectly fine to do). At Bryan's suggestion, we took a short walk outside at night, up the stairs at end of the street to see a wow view of the Space Needle and downtown Seattle. Feel like we got my spot here now in DT Seattle - would definitely stay here again - Thanks, Bryan, for a totally comfortable, stress-free stay - it really does make a difference when your host is considerate and cares."
44307621,753404504,,14158636,Tom,"Bart is a spectacular host, and the unit is clean, comfortable, and in a perfect part of town, probably the best in Seattle for quick access to the best things in the city in any direction."
41377176,606910969,,141600876,Ben,"Julie was an outstanding host and truly made us feel at home for the weekend! She went above and beyond to make us feel welcomed and the process convenient when we checked ourselves in. The house was very clean and wonderfully located! Julie made sure we had everything we needed to be comfortable and enjoy our stay. I’ve stayed at a lot of Airbnbs and enjoyed them all, but I would have to say that staying at this house was the best experience I’ve had yet! I would highly recommend staying at this cute house!"
19914644,189457747,,141610545,Emily,"Corey and Sandy are wonderful hosts! I just moved to Seattle but my apartment wasn't ready right away, so I stayed for a little over a month. They were super hospitable, and they thought to include everything that one might need during the stay. Great location as well!"
42894717,757161403,,141687364,Andrew,What an amazing place! The home is absolutely gorgeous with plenty of space and beds for our large group. The deck and outdoor space is fantastic. Eric was extremely responsive and accommodating. I can't recommend this place enough!
19493701,173735386,,141728894,Andrew,Perry is a very kind and welcoming host. Even though the house may look cluttered and like it's been through a lot this only adds to its coziness. You definitely feel like you're just a part of the family while you're there. <br/>Lots of neat places are surprisingly within walking distance of the house including the Woodland Park Zoo and the neighborhood is quiet and safe. Definitely a nice place to meet some new folks and have a comfortable bed during your stay.
27875010,315805829,,14191025,Joy,"Great value, comfortable and clean."
46509653,723550543,,141926708,Y,"Tanesha’s place was amazing. I spent most of my time sleeping but I contribute that to how nice the bed was. The driveway to get to the house is a little steep so if your car is modified to be lower than it is, you might have problems getting up the hill lol. During times of COVID, I appreciate everything that was put into place to help, such as disposable gloves, alcohol wipes, and hand sanitizer. Thank you for having me!"
2037250,10768984,,1422547,Ryan,Fantastic house. Fantastic host. The steam room was sublime. Sheldon rules!
8.23E+17,8.97E+17,,142528410,Bryan,"Absolutely stunning inside and out. Special touches provided! A flower and card complimentary wine. Extra linens, amazing views! An absolute beautiful retreat!! The host was wonderful, responsive and provided unique touches! I would return weekly if I could!"
22038201,217547848,,142536781,Raziuddin,Good stay!
14903598,179550109,,142650346,Paula,"The description is just as Michael described. I know Alki can be a busy area during the day, so I was concerned about parking. I contacted Michael before booking, and he assured me there was plenty of street parking. When we arrived, there was a lot of parking, and most times, right out front. This was a very convenient area to stay while we visited friends that live in West Seattle, and were getting married on Vashon Island. Great spot to stay if you plan to visit the islands."
49107811,748042319,,142676910,Jorge,Magic's place was great. Very quick/easy to message with them and the place is in a great location.
20077617,182517197,,142740053,Jiachen,"The apartment was clean, quiet, and well decorated"
7.68E+17,8.9E+17,,142891608,Monty And Sandy,"One of the all time best Airbnb we've stayed at anywhere. There are mind blowing views of Elliott Bay, the market and the Olympic Mountains. Pike Place is literally around the corner, and the kitchen is well equipped for taking advantage of all the fresh fish. The building staff are wonderful, and Gala was a great host."
9303743,72954562,,14292605,Alberto,Raggiungere la casa è stato semplice. Casa confortevole e situata in un quartiere tranquillo.
1629525,248543467,,143040941,Bethany,"I loved Deb’s place! It was extremely clean, cozy, and Deb was definitely the hostess with the mostess. I highly recommend."
20995122,209714632,,1431621,Shannon,"I absolutely LOVED staying at Sara’s Airbnb cottage. She has created the most perfect space ever! She has thought through every detail! It is aesthetic and well designed. There is coffee, a washer/dryer, an interesting book selection, beautiful art and so much more. I seriously cannot rave on enough! It is very, very clean and in a wonderful safe family neighborhood. Honestly, perfect in every way!!!! I would not hesitate to stay again when I am in Seattle. I LOVED IT."
6852960,36621114,,14324005,Kavita,"We had a good time staying at Lawrence Lofts. The space itself is very nice and was stylishly furnished. The location is pretty good, too (if you don't mind walking uphill). I would stay here again, but there were some hiccups. They were not super communicative over email the day or two before we arrived and didn't explain how to get into the unit since we arrived after the leasing office closed at 6 p.m. Luckily, we called on our way and got the information we needed. But once the office closed on Saturday evening, there wasn't anybody to answer our questions about wifi and parking. And there were little things that were kind of annoying such as no extra rolls of toilet paper, the bathroom trash had not been taken out, and the hand soap in the bathroom was pretty much empty when we got there. The parking situation was also confusing. The man we spoke to on the phone tried to explain where to park and we thought we were in the right space but had a sticker on our window Monday morning saying we would be towed the next day if we didn't move. It wasn't a big deal since we were checking out that day, but was still kind of annoying.<br/>This is a building that caters to renters and they seem to do Airbnb on the side. So they still have some quirks to work out, including improving communication. Still, it was a nice space and in a good location so I would consider staying here again if I ironed out some of these issues in advance including who to contact for questions when the leasing office was closed."
35340461,528279517,,1434912,Peder,"ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!! from quick responses to an amazing space with so much detail to ensure your stay will be perfect! New, clean, comfy and located in a great area close to everything! Kristi rocks and was there for anything we needed <br/>It’s a must stay!!!"
20169621,179559803,,143572275,Mike,Fantastic location and lovely unit. My colleagues had a great time. Lots of good bars and restaurants within walking distance too!
12379796,92063803,,1437055,Alex,"The apartment was very comfortable, clean and quiet. The bed was fantastic and the neighborhood is great. Very good food, drinks and coffee within walking distance. Very happy to have stayed here!"
43519844,634336804,,14374018,Roxanne,This is a really beautiful space with accommodating hosts. My son and I stayed here for a father/son weekend and loved walking to different parts of the neighborhood. We were so comfortable and felt like we were in a high end rental. Would stay again. Thanks!
20881419,196620260,,143818328,Lexi,"Jon and Saro treated us like a member of the family. The home was beautiful and we had everything we needed and more. They were very fun to spend time with and it honestly was like living with friends you had known for a while. The 2 dogs were so sweet and added to the home. This is the best place to stay if you would like to easily travel around Seattle, as it's diagonal from a bus stop that runs straight to Pike Place. This place and the people are 5 stars."
20692613,197112842,,143849824,L.,"Perfectly placed in a quiet neighborhood, not to far from the excitement. The parking off street was nice and the trail behind the house was so convenient. I enjoyed the layout of the home it was well stocked clean and tidy and amenities were awesome. I would stay over and over again. Let me add that the host was perfect as well"
20279587,182068797,,143885979,Patricia,"Marti's place was a lovely retreat with the convenience of a bus stop to easily access any of Seattle or surrounding areas. She and Bonnie, her playful dog, welcomed my daughter and I with a book of local restaurants, maps, and bus routes, which we found very helpful. Her place is well kept and she offers various food and drink options in the room, which was great when we were getting around in the morning or getting home late from a long day. She gives you privacy, but was more than happy to visit and offer information that we may find helpful. Overall, a very pleasant place to stay."
19386335,178544233,,144204810,Cary,"If you need a nice, quiet easy place to stay, this is great! Perry was as helpful as anyone could be. Highly recommended."
3273240,14881091,,14422460,Rich,"This place is in the heart of Pioneer Square in a very cool turn of the century building. The famous State Room Hotel sign is literally right outside the window and the many tours that pass by always point out this sign - so they all see your smiling face through these wonderful full-wall windows. The hustle and bustle of Pioneer Square is exciting. Keep in mind this is the heart of Seattle nightlife. I walked to the baseball game, the pier, downtown Seattle - all very convenient.<br/><br/>The bed is very comfortable. The apartment studio and building is very clean and has all the amenities you would need. The kitchen is fully stocked, there is a great seating area, and the bathroom was very clean. <br/><br/>Most important, Bonnie was great. She answered all my questions. I highly recommend this studio for a short or long term stay."
254340,780157,,1442497,Jason,"Waaay better than hoped for. Felt like a new, cozy, fully furnished apt. Not to mention spotless. Surprising treats and all the amenities and a few extras. Hosts went out of their way to be helpful and accomodating. 3 minute walk to restaurants and pubs. I'll be staying here in the future. Perfect access for Ballard and Fremont."
340706,994697,,1443725,Moritz,We really enjoyed our stay! The aparment is really really nice and has lots of details that makes you feel very comfortable. The conection to downtown is fast and easy. And David and his son were great host:) Highly recommended!
34409642,484425484,,144535406,Victor,Great host! Beautiful home! Would recommend to anyone wanting a gorgeous view
36603045,499634730,,14464650,Maurice,"Accueil très chaleureux de Dan. The main entry and hallway need to be renovate. Once you pass the entry and the hallway, you will arrive at the boarding gate .<br/>The studio had a complete renovation et it was clean with a 1950 feel. It makes you think you are at home with a taste for details ."
48187886,4.64E+17,,144704688,Shawn,Barbara’s place was so nice for our week long stay near Seattle. The bedroom was very cozy and we had everything we needed for long term stay in the kitchen with laundry as well. Barbara was also very accommodating and was quick to respond to our requests. Me and my girlfriend loved this place so much we would gladly stay here again
8080939,65903255,,14484962,Steve,"This place was perfect for us. We needed a place to stay for a few days while getting some work done on our house. The apartment was beautifully done, clean and comfortable. The view from the deck was fantastic. The neighborhood is s very walkable and close to great restaurants. Easy access to I-5 made my morning commute stress free. Kelly was very responsive so working out logistics and getting additional information was easy. Great experience for us! Thank you"
20501756,208291443,,144936511,Mohammed,"I would recommend Mike and Cynthia's place to anyone. They helped me with English conversation and with my homework. The room is very large with lots of storage and there is a wonderful garden for relaxing.<br/>The house is clean and there is a cleaner available every 2 weeks. The kids are fun to be around and quiet at night when I'm sleeping. <br/>The busses are very close to the house, only a 30 second walk, and I take one every day to University of Washington. Thank you and I hope to come back again!"
8.51E+17,8.73E+17,,145209147,Jose,Great place to stay for a week in Seattle! Vince was very helpful with anything we needed and gave tons of great recommendations!
50683834,4.47E+17,,145235868,Luke,"This place was pretty good. There were a few things that were frustrating, but overall it was good enough for what I needed. <br/>Good: It was clean and larger than I expected for a studio. It's obviously old, but it was well taken care of. The kitchen was separate from the living room/bedroom. There was a nice desk if you need to get work done in the apartment. Really big walk in closet. Bed was comfortable and there was a fully reclining futon/couch type thing. Don't know if this is the same in all the apartments. Melissa was pretty easy to contact and was very flexible when I had to change around my date of departure several times. Appliances are old, but work fine. Location is great, tons of really good restaurants really close by. Cool rooftop bar across the street. Neptune theater right around the corner. There is a small convenience store attached to the building that was very convenient. <br/>Bad: The building next door is currently being demolished (9/2021) and it is loud during business hours. Don't know how long it will be until they're done. There is also a parking garage being built across the street that is quite loud. Otherwise I never heard noise from neighbors. Internet was great when it was working. In my apartment, I was stuck between two routers which meant the internet was fine on one side of the apartment and terrible on the other side. Luckily it was good in the area I had the desk placed so I could get work done. Parking lot is large, but costs $200 per month. If you don't get a monthly pass it costs like $18/day or something. There is only one large pot so if you want to cook anything, bring your own pots. No elevator if you need to move anything heavy."

490076,13479778,,14703146,Andrew,"My parents stayed at Ann's apartment during their recent visit. They enjoyed the location with both walking distance to both upper and lower Fremont. The neighborhood had beautiful lush foliage, and the kitchen was well-stocked with utensils and cooking gear. Ann provided tourist information about Seattle and Fremont, which helped us plan things to do. Overall, they enjoyed their stay."
33717119,461549571,,1472460,Ryan,"My wife and I spent a month in Tim’s clean and well appointed studio in the heart of Queen Anne. The location is ideal and Tim has stocked the place with everything you will need for your visit. As residents of the City for over ten years, we were impressed with what Queen Anne has to offer and enjoyed being walking distance to all the shops and restaurants of the Ave. For out of town visitors, the location is perfect for those wanting to explore the sites of downtown (Space Needle, Chihuly Garden of Glass, etc) but also desiring a peaceful night’s rest close to restaurants.<br/>Tim was a very responsive and communicative host. Thanks again for a great stay!"
43777419,639569247,,147270389,Forrest,"What a way to spend the summer! Eli and Kaitlin were such great hosts. They were interactive and fun, yet gave us space when we needed it.

23127965,267444304,,1474386,Valena,"Absolutely a fabulous place, location, and deal. I would recommend this to anyone in a heartbeat. Loved the location - we were able to walk to many places downtown and had a lovely view of the city, plus a coffee shop two blocks away. The apartment is lovely - very nice bathroom and kitchen, it's a perfect cozy space. The hosts were kind, responsive, and available when needed but otherwise we didn't cross paths. Perfect! I really would stay in the place again (and again and again)."
33172197,446973490,,1475581,Thomas,We enjoyed our stay with Mo. The place is at a good location in case you like to explore downtown and capitol hill.

We stayed for 9 nights and really enjoyed all the amenities - grilling and eating outside, trampoline, foosball, cooking & dining together, tv and lots of games. My 8 year old was in heaven! Mount Rainier Beach neighborhood is quiet. Enjoyed nearby Kubota Gardens and Seward Park as well. Casey and Samantha were fantastic hosts - very responsive as we got settled in & check in/out a breeze. Highly recommend."

Hosts are very helpful and incredibly responsive. We’ll definitely stay again in the future.
1042022,4408895,,1483158,Megen,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Though we did not spend as much time in the Madison Park area as we expected, we found it to be the perfect place to start and finish our day. The apartment is well decorated and the thoughtful touches (snacks from Trader Joes & a stack of books for our two year old) were much appreciated. We would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking to visit Madison Park or downtown Seattle (so long as you don't mind a good walk to start the day or taking public transportation in the city)."

7638263,53287182,,14858908,Terry,"Last week I had my first experience with Airbnb, at the home of Brian in Seattle. It couldn't have been any better! My accommodations were comfortable and immaculate, the coffee maker was ready every morning, and I had complete privacy. The dogs, Albert and Flash, were friendly, quiet, and never around unless I asked to see them. The location was perfect, just one block from friends I was visiting. The neighborhood is quiet and safe, and Brian's home is just a block from the bus stop, with quick and easy access to downtown. Just down the street from the bus is a wonderful bakery/cafe called Grand Central with authentic French croissants, among many delicious menu items. There's also a wonderful Italian restaurant, Serafina, in walking distance.<br/>My schedule included a late arrival and a late departure, which Brian graciously accommodated.<br/>If you are looking for a comfortable place in a great location, I highly recommend Brian's Eastlake Private Room!"
31145360,365873703,,149031741,Gisel,This was our first time in Seattle and we could not have made a better choice for our stay. Stacy and Guillermo’s place was cozy and well equipped and had everything we needed for our stay. The king size bed was comfortable and perfect to rest in after a day of sightseeing.

20460194,192630500,,149436352,Nicole,"Wow, this little cottage is wonderfully appointed in the beautiful Green Lake area of Seattle. We had a wonderful visit with our two young children. Green Lake and dining is within two blocks. We were able to take our bikes and ride the scenic 3-miles around the lake and the kids enjoyed the playground at the park. The Woodland Zoo is only 5 minutes away and downtown Seattle is a 15m drive. Jodi is a fantastic host and was VERY helpful with all of our needs. Highly recommend and will definitely stay here again! Thanks Jodi!"
2612399,13099001,,14943699,Olivia,Phil was very welcoming even at midnight! The loft was quaint and surrounded by plants and flowers on the patio. The ladder to bed was always a treat after a long days out n about. The park next door was awesome and home was super close to dowtown! Awesome experience! I will be back to Seattle.
229990,280657031,,149485201,Thai,Great place and great host. Wayne’s “world” is a great location and next time i have family visiting i will definitely hit Wayne up again. A+++<br/> have been happier.

23523959,4.16E+17,,149594848,Katylynn,"The host is nice and very responsive. The place is located in U district close to the UWMC hospital which was nice, but the area was a bit sketchy."

19849588,187870292,,1498305,Molly,"Gerard's place was just wonderful, and every interaction with Gerard himself was a pleasure. His property featured a private room, en suite bathroom, and balcony above from the host - very comfortable and private, and in a GREAT location in Ballard: just a few blocks away from everything the neighborhood has to offer. Gerard as a host was so welcoming and accommodating - he picked us up (delicious!) fresh baked goods in the mornings from a local bakery, was available for any questions and always responded promptly. He was also kind enough to invite us to a BBQ he was having - we just felt very welcomed and taken care of while totally having our privacy. Would highly recommend to anyone wanting to check out Ballard or just having a comfy base for Seattle exploration!! (Thanks, Gerard!)"
51621701,5.73E+17,,150220184,Liz,"A cozy and functional basement apartment! Location was pretty nice, very close to Ballard's brewery district. Seema was a very communicative host."
14302656,95657646,,15025961,Jeff,"This place is amazing. The house is super clean and nicely decorated. I was totally impressed the minute I walked into the door. I already decided to go to IKEA this weekend to pick up several items to help to decorate my room. <br/><br/>The whole house was hooked up with music integration. I could easily airplay music through my smart phone to the stereo system. Brian even provided HBO go and Netflix in his media room, which we enjoyed a lot. <br/><br/>I slept in the master bedroom. The memory foam bed and pillows are so comfortable. It really helped me to recover from the city tour and long drives. The area was really quiet at night. <br/><br/>All in all, I really enjoyed this house. Brian left us a booklet for us. It covers all the info on how to operate all the systems (speakers, skylight, things like that. ) we found it super useful and friendly. I totally recommend this place."
2948548,14434390,,15029348,Travon,The host responded quickly to my questions. The host is pleasant and accommodating. The host accommodated our very late arrival to Seattle. The apartment is conveniently located to bus stops and a very short walk to the University of Washington campus. The apartment is quiet and clean with newer appliances. However it could use more utensils and pots/pans.

41535117,629315145,,150388361,Emily,I am very happy that Fabio opened his place up to me during the COVID pandemic. As a nurse working in downtown Seattle Fabio’s place was exactly what I was looking for!

About 10 minute walk to Link Light Rail, which will connect you to everything from SEATAC to UW. Went to the Mariners game with no parking or traffic hassles. Apartment is cozy and extremely quiet. Located on the back side if the building: no street noise or lights. Well stocked. Shower rocks."
41030199,754366772,,150682731,Noelle,"Hands down the best Airbnb I’ve ever stayed in! Space was bright, immaculately clean, modern and spacious. Felt very private and secure as well! Check-in and check-out process was a breeze and the location couldn’t have been better.<br/>Nick and Esther were very responsive if we needed them and generously offered us a late checkout as there were no guests arriving that day.<br/>During the second night of our stay, we happened to be out of the unit when our food was delivered. Nick had seen our food get delivered and courteously placed our food inside the door so it wouldn’t be sitting on the street while we were gone. Very kind!<br/>Overall, such a wonderful stay and worth every penny. Will 100% be returning if we stay in the area again. Thank you Nick & Esther!"

Katherine also checked in periodically to make sure we were enjoying our stay. <br/>Her apartment is immaculately clean and centrally located. It is a 9 min walk away from major grocery stores with easy access to downtown and buses that stop directly in front of the building.

It was great to have our own little spot with a nice porch. The only note I'll add is you have to walk through one bedroom to get to the other but was not an issue for our group! Would stay here again."

6.71E+17,8.64E+17,,15453982,Marzia,"If there was a Global Top 10 Airbnb I would nominate this place. <br/>Without listing all the amazing things: great location, safe neighborhood, house immaculate, super speedy communication which would make this place already a 5 star stay.<br/>Kathryn was from the get go very warm and kind, but especially proactive in foreseeing what her guests need. Examples include offering earlier check-in as she understood how difficult it is traveling with a baby.<br/>Her home reflects her attention to detail: only place in all the Airbnb that I stayed, both US/EU/Asia that provided laundry bags, stain removers, even oil essences! Small things that made me feel right at home. Only place in the States that finally provided compostable bags, even for general trash (love the planet people!). <br/>Extra personal touches: a little duck bath toy for my baby!<br/>Her guest service even included fetching things that we lost after we check out. <br/>A TRUE GEM!! I would stay with her over any five star hotel.<br/>???????? ????"

48475623,755412754,,155368929,Nhi,"5 stars! <3<br/>Very cute place and everything was clean. Also, the interior decor was spot on. I love it very much and the vibes are on point. <br/>Bedroom was beautiful. I love the theme in each room. Bed was a little hard but it’s probably might be new or more on the firm side perhaps. No big deal, it’s just preference that’s all. I like my mattress soft and you can sink your whole body in. There’s extra bedding in the closets also. The desk was lovely and I appreciate the live plants. Can I like move in? lol <br/>Kitchen had all the necessities that you would needed, thank you!! There’s coffee, creamer, and sugar too! I was “working from home” so coffee was much needed. If you’re a cook like me, you will appreciate the kitchen. There’s spices as well. <br/>Bathroom was heaven! There’s shampoo, conditioner, and body wash provided. However, I brought my own but that’s convenient if you didn’t have any. There’s fancy mirrors with led lights and they don’t fog for some reason. I tried figuring it out - oh technology! That’s my favorite thing while putting on my skincare. I want one now! There’s a dryer and washer in there as well if you need to wash your clothes. <br/>Side note, there is a touchscreen lock to get into the house but there is also a manual bottom lock. You have to keep the bottom lock unlock to use the touchscreen lock. If you lock the bottom lock, you cannot get in. I was locked out but they were very responsive and let me in quickly. <br/>Overall, I had a pleasant experience with everything and would definitely visit again!"
38383343,9.23E+17,,155415591,Michelle,Best airbnb we’ve stayed at! The home is beautiful with several beautiful outdoor spaces to relax in. The kitchen has all of the things needed to feel like you’re cooking at home. The hosts have thought of everything needed to have an awesome Seattle stay!

I cannot believe we found a place that not only was a great deal for the four of us traveling, but one with such charm and hospitality. They left fruit out of us and her family even baked for us one morning. All four of us were blown away by their attentiveness and kindness. We will be coming back in the very near future, that is if they will have us!"
23329400,258205619,,156454872,Shea,"The stay was great. It felt like a little apartment, in one of the best areas of Seattle."

24809443,268080279,,157198627,Katie & Danny,"This was one of my best experiences staying in an Air BnB. Hailey was on top of the communication: quick to respond, extremely helpful and friendly. Check-in was smooth and I was pleasantly surprised to be greeted with some goodies that made this whole experience even more homey and special. <br/>The apartment itself was amazing and I wish I could have spent more time there. The kitchen was modern, clean, and had everything I needed to make meals during my stay. The beds were comfortable and cozy - I got some great sleep! The place truly stays quiet at night. I could hear the family below in the afternoon/early evening but it didn’t feel disruptive to my stay at all. The entrance requires walking up a flight of stairs, but once you’re up there, it feels very private which I enjoyed. <br/>The location was perfect. Very centrally located: quick bus ride downtown or easy walks to several fun spots in Fremont. It’s a great neighborhood to check out if you’re visiting from out of town. It was so enjoyable to stay in this apartment and interact with Dave and Hailey; I will seek this place out the next time I visit Seattle!"
39199725,552865852,,157211590,Amy,"We had a great stay at the cottage! Super clean and comfortable, exactly as pictured. Within a 10 minute walk we found a bunch of restaurants, a grocery store, etc. Easy bus ride downtown. Allison was super helpful, even loaning us an umbrella! 10/10 would stay there again."
28581267,358529518,,157272121,Brett,Malinda's place is very comfortable and has a spectacular view of Lake Washington.
18213259,145563013,,15732852,Krzysztof,"The apartment was clean, comfortable and well-equipped. Checkin was easy and Eliza was very responsive and helpful. Parking was very convenient. Terrific access to the city, Ballard and Interbay. Easy bus ride downtown. Quick walk to QFC grocery store. About 5 mins from Whole Foods. Would love to stay here again. Highly recommended! Thank you Eliza!"
48354117,752480288,,157672350,Jorge,Excellent location
29848922,365759265,,157792522,Michael,Kim's place was easy to find and very clean. The kitchen had great appliances and plenty of room. The bed was extremely comfortable and had nice bedding. They were thoughtful and responsive to my needs and the parking right by the door couldn't have been more convenient. They even brought me cookies on Christmas Eve. Nice touch.
27023519,304027693,,15810489,Mandy,"We had a fabulous time at Salon de rue cerise. The building housing the studio is absolutely beautiful with a very interesting history in the Pioneer Square historical district. The area is a bit rough round the edges, but we did not feel at all uncomfortable or unsafe. We love to walk and explore and the location was perfect for this. The studio was spotlessly clean, huge comfy bed and good bathroom. Jane was great at responding to our queries and left us some welcome gifts on arrival. We would definitely recommend staying here."
8941541,72344618,,15831753,Rusdeep,"Had a great stay at Tri's Pike/Pine apartment! Tri was an amazing host and went out of his way to make sure my needs were met. The apt interior had a simple modern style and was nice, clean, and spacious. Since I was only staying for two nights, I didn't take advantage of all the amenities such as the outdoor little patio or the kitchen (which had nice new appliances). The huge plus apartment is the location- Capitol Hill is a great neighborhood and this apt is right near all the restaurants and bars. In addition, its close to downtown (~15-20 minute walk) and less than a 10 minute walk to the Light rail. The only potential downside is if you have a big group, there is only one bathroom. But in my view, this was an amazing deal terms of quality and location. Couldn't have asked for a better experience."
21424409,213096270,,158471308,Amy,"Stayed for 3 nights, 4 days and this studio and location were perfect! Did a lot of sight-seeing and only used an Uber once since everything was within walking distance (as stated.) Since it is a central location, it did get a bit noisy during the night. Jeff let us know ahead of time (before my BF and I arrived) that there would be some construction going on. We had some issues connecting to the Wi-Fi originally listed. But before I could reach out to Jeff to address the issue, I saw he had already contacted me with updated info. Needless to say, Jeff was very prompt in responding to any questions or concerns we had. I would definitely stay here or at any Airbnb of Jeff's if I visit Seattle again. It was my first Airbnb and had a great experience overall."
23414672,247244210,,15856701,Karson,"A great location in Seattle. Jason was a great host, check-in was super easy, and would definitely come back here to stay again!"
210316,13981528,,15859129,Caroline,"We really enjoyed our stay at Flor's ""Five-star"" furnished room. The room had everything anyone would want, the most comfortable bed, and she provided lots of extra services, like breakfast and rides, for reasonable fees, making our stay even easier on us. It was the best omelet we've ever had. She was responsive to our needs, and an all-around nice person. Her back yard was a lovely place to sit. The neighborhood is quiet and convenient to transportation. We would come back if we're in Seattle, and will recommend her place to others."
23237667,240377221,,158611433,Rachael,"Carmen' s apartment is a great space. Private access, apartment opens to wonderful garden space, great location. Carmen was extremely hospitable, easy to get in touch with and knows the area well. Would definitely stay again and/or recommend. Thank you, Carmen!"

21717918,214345839,,158669181,Justin,This is a great for traveling. This bed was so sweet. This place is close to downtown and Pike Market.
31462782,442896994,,158757159,Nancy,"So beautiful, spacious and clean. Close to so many walkable restaurants, stores and coffee shops."
2995996,15454931,,15876379,David,"Ron was a most welcoming and caring host for us during our stay at the Green House. We were in the main and second floor space and the accommodations were spacious and very comfortable for the four of us. The kitchen was fully equipped. Ron was available at any time by phone though we never needed to call him because he had already provided everything we needed.<br/>The neighborhood retail center is literally two blocks away with restaurants and a convenience store. Two bus routes stop there - one to downtown the other to Seattle Center, i.e. the space needle. Groceries are only six blocks away, but it is up a long hill, so we would recommend the bus.<br/>"
39439816,4.6E+17,,159028908,Victoria,Awesome location very close to everything- just park around the neighborhood. Clean and cute apartment! Enjoyed the surprise champagne and personal home touches. :)

2989758,13771903,,15912168,Jonathan,Desdemona:<br/>Your place was wonderful -- you could tell it has been meticulously rehabbed with great style and comfort in mind. The neighborhood is quaint for walks and walkable to everything Fremont has to offer. I appreciated your attention to anything we needed to make sure we had a great stay. Thank you! I would to love to stay at your place again next time I'm in Seattle.
30176806,358818542,,159364710,Keashia,"First off- safe, convenient parking included.<br/>Don't let the neighbourhood scare you.<br/>Embrace and appreciate Seattle's diversity!<br/>Proximity to light rail is very convenient.<br/>Spacious, stylish and clean apartment.<br/>Lots of extras. <br/>Washer/dryer and ample hot water. Fully equipped and stocked kitchen.<br/>Just a lovely place!<br/>Highly recommend."
5241773,27525736,,15945059,Alice,"This was a wonderful AirBnB experience for me - a last minute plan that worked, and was much improved, by staying with Louis. I had some logistics to accommodate which he took in stride. The communication ahead of time made the arrangements clear, the room was great, the location was what initially attracted me to the listing and proved to be ideal, and what started as a place to stay turned into a lovely experience that started my day in Seattle just right - with sunshine (unusual, I know, and probably not always part of staying there) and fantastic suggestions about where to explore. Louis made me feel very welcome - and helped me avoid my introverted tendencies by making it clear I wasn't imposing. I certainly plan to stay here again next time I am in Seattle."
13390576,593083251,,159541544,Deanne,"Michelle’s place is one of the most beautiful Airbnb’s I’ve stayed at. The location was close to the airport and wasn’t far from downtown Seattle at all. Check in was super easy and convenient. Her house had all the amenities needed, and more (also was super high tech). Michelle is a great host, she responded super fast and at all times of day, she even gave great recommendations for different types of restaurants (what we came for Seattle for). If anyone is looking for a really nice place to stay at and wants convenience to go around the city, Michelle’s place is the place to stay at. I would definitely recommend everyone to stay at Michelle’s, unless you can’t really walk up a steep hill. Her driveway is kind of steep but 10/10 overall!"

661708,265340059,,15988309,Sarah,"Roberta's townhouse is exactly as pictured. It's in a beautiful location, right by the Arboretum, making for a great launching point for jogs or morning walks. There is also easy on-street parking, which is an added perk. Uber rides throughout the city can be had for about $10-15 at most, so it's not tricky to move about if you want to leave the car behind. Thanks, Roberta, for the hospitality!"
26448906,284588168,,159951,Elizabeth,"Beautiful space, that is newly remodeled. Everything is brand new and very, very clean. This studio has plenty of room for a couple. Parking was easy (and free). Check-in was easy, with great communication from Nick. We love staying in the Ballard neighborhood when we come up to visit Seattle, it is a little over a mile walk to the main commerce strip (Market St.). Highly recommend checking out the Farmers Market on Sunday. Would happily stay in this studio again."
21368342,291958290,,159976525,Adrianne,This was a beautiful house in a great location. Very modern and had everything we needed. We will definitely be back.
1603124,7951246,,1601417,Alexey,"The apartment appeared to be even better than we expected. Very clean and comfortable, really quiet, but the neighborhood is perfect — dozens of cafes/ restaurants, good transportation etc.<br/>Melissa is a great host, very welcoming and extremely helpful with any issues we had. We're really happy about our choice and would definitely recommend this apartment (and Melissa as a host - she has several other options) to anyone who's looking for a comfortable and nicely placed apartment in Seattle."
50200463,4.44E+17,,160233623,Sydney,"Taliya was the best host, and this spot was the best location! A quick mile-ish walk to the link station, very easy access to the freeway (and Trader Joe’s next door!) this spot couldn’t be beat. The apartment was clean, safe, and overall great"
49300715,755113372,,160255295,James,"So I booked this room under a different AirBnB host, “Beans”. Jan is the owner of the building and has been restoring it for almost 40 years. She is an amazing spirit and you will undoubtedly see her making repairs and meticulously maintaining the building. Half the experience of staying here is getting the chance to talk with her and listening to the history of the place and even some of her own.<br/>The room itself was very comfortable and true to its 1910’s aesthetic. The bed was warm and cozy. Also true to its age, the window glass is thin so if you’re a light sleeper bring ear plugs. There is only ONE OUTLET (that IS compatible with 21st century plugs) with two ports, both of which are occupied by light fixtures in the room so you’ll need to triage your appliance needs. There is only a hand sink in the room with a bar of soap.<br/>The shared toilet/shower (on this floor near the room) was barebones. The shower water does not get hot is a light spray to the point that it loses the little bit of warmth it had coming out by the time it hits your skin. But this is the 1910’s experience, right?<br/>One thing right off the bat that unnerved me was the whole doorman style entrance. You will not have a key to get into the building and 7/10 times that I needed to enter there was nobody there to let me in and I had to either call the hotel number (unanswered at times) to reach the guy on duty or bother Jan in the middle of her work to have her walk down two flights of stairs and open the door. I’m all for this classic door service, but they need to be there!<br/>My other real issue was the lack of WiFi in the guest room. You can get a weak signal in the common room, but it’s not an ideal space to hold Zoom meetings.<br/>All in all, please PLEASE support the restoration of this historic gem. You will get an authentic antiquated experience. Just be prepared for its quirks. We all have them. Kudos to Jan for her efforts all these years."
25356262,270935012,,160377926,Kori,"We had a wonderful stay in Seattle, thanks in no small part to this fantastic space! The amenities were more than we expected and the bed was very comfortable! Sleek modern styling tucked away in a quaint neighborhood just a short ride away from downtown. I highly recommend staying here!!"
48112212,734842347,,160528030,Anirudh,"Belle and G were fantastic hosts! The house was an absolute steal at the price that I got it for, and the kitchen was very useful to use! I especially liked the stylish shelves that were in the living room, and would absolutely recommend staying here again!"
26566116,286202336,,160579918,Tiana,First time using a guest apartment. All in all didn’t even feel like we were under someone’s house with the amount of probably that was offered. & our host went above and beyond to accomadge our check in and check out! Highly recommend.
39135549,570526653,,16070903,Nina,"The place is really nice and spotlessly clean. The space is well organized and our family had a great time. Julie left flowers in the house with wine, some chocolate and popcorn. The location is nice and easy to find. <br/>Drawbacks - it’s on a main street and you can hear the traffic. The garage is so tiny the minivan we rented wouldn’t even fit in it."
18737568,153306149,,16073380,Alison,"Great stay! Rob was very responsive and kind. From what I understand, we were one of first guests... so some minor improvements to be made but easy fixes. The space is very large. The walls are thin and we could hear other tenants.. so brings ear plugs or white noise. Bathroom outdated but clean. Bed very comfy! Location great. Would recommend."
8.22E+17,9.05E+17,,160749611,Bana,"Okay overall stay. Very cozy. Communicative host, easy checkin."
21644920,219141517,,160752858,Debra,"This AirBnB host is one of the best - simply as a kind and attentive individual. This was our first experience with using Air BnB and Linda's quick response, accessibility for questions and clarification and just basic kindness won't soon be forgotten. This was a great experience! We definitely recommend her!"
27496043,317141587,,16087101,Benjamin,"Super comfortable house, feels very private and luxurious!"
26425599,288431006,,160878087,Carl,"Guy was a great host and we had an awesome time!! He was very helpful and his home was perfect for hosting, everything from cooking and grilling with ease to tons of great local recommendations. The house is located in a safe clean neighborhood with an awesome view and really cool deck/patio for entertaining. I will try to rent this house anytime I come to Seattle."
49534257,756864418,,16109587,Elizabeth,"Super unique, with fascinating history. It's a bit rough around the edges in some ways, but I found it beautiful and delightful."
13843060,98628533,,16131450,Robert,"Charlie is a wonderful host, quick to respond and attentive to the details. This a cute little backyard place on a near 100 year old property. <br/>Inside seems new with just enough eclectia to make it work. Clean, spotless and well equipped - with a wonderful mattress. <br/>3 blocks to multiple eateries and on the south end of the university bridge."
25458599,277602666,,161354336,Uyen,"Our family really enjoyed our stay at Andy & Lynne's home. The Berlin Wall was beautiful, clean, and has amazing amenities.

51195923,5.33E+17,,162222105,John,"We had a pretty good stay at the Summit building. The location is fairly good, with the light rail station about 10 minutes' walk up the hill. There is a small grocery store, a friendly pub and a good coffee/donut shop all about two blocks away. We stayed for 2 months and felt fairly comfortable. <br/>The apartment itself was acceptable. The bed was very comfortable and having several closets was great. Equipment was as stated in the listing; furniture was acceptable (though not all pieces were very clean. ) The kitchen had minimal supplies. On the good side, management was helpful and responsive -- when we had a problem with the plumbing they answered right away and got a repairman in to do the necessary fix. <br/>Note that several apartments in this building are potentially available; not all look just like the illustration in the AirBnB listing. Our apartment was on the 2nd floor and had no sunlight, so we felt a bit like living in a cave. Moreover, because the windows in the bedroom and living room were just a few feet from a pedestrian walkway, we had no privacy unless we kept the shades closed. <br/>One notable inconvenience is that the coin-up clothes washer and dryer in the basement require a total of 14 quarters (!!!) to wash and dry every load. Trying to rustle up that kind of change every time you want to wash your clothes is a hassle. There is no electronic payment option."
25224607,315043888,,16228157,Daphne,What an interesting interiour has this house and a very nice garden! We really enjoyed the place and Darcy makes great breakfasts!
22107747,219488034,,162448842,Malia,"Even though our stay was short, we loved it. The place was adorable, spotless, and you could tell they tried to make it as “homey” as possible. <br/>We loved the little touches of creamer packets with the keurig, extra blankets to use, and the book with their favorite local spots (we stopped at their suggested coffee shop which was very cute by the way). <br/>Definitely reccomend staying here!"
15776053,111928246,,16244976,Leslie,"I absolutely loved my stay at Karl's while I was in Seattle. The apartment was so cozy and had everything I needed, probably more. The view of the Sound was gorgeous, and with the windows facing West a sunset was always in order. The location was great near enough to Fremont and Downtown without too much hustle and bustle, and close to the bus stop and bike trails. Karl was a great host as well, always flexible and available with anything I needed to help make my stay more comfortable and pleasant. I will miss this place :)"
21490495,224266428,,162483769,Lysa & Doug,Great location and immediate response from owner/manager. Would definitely recommend to a friend!
6716874,35852243,,16273302,Kadie,We had a great stay. Thomas & John were fabulous hosts. The space was beautiful & clean (it's brand new)! And the bed was very comfortable. I am planning on staying with them again the next time I go to Seattle!
26880154,300704196,,162808698,Lauren,This was such a fabulous stay! The hosts went above and beyond. We loved the electric kettle in the room for coffee and tea. The bathroom was gorgeous! Horton (the bunny) was extra cuuute :) would recommend this stay to anyone- one of my best air bnb experiences for sure!

20820051,221524407,,163237695,Kevin,"We had a great stay at this West Seattle cottage. Tim and Sunny were fantastic hosts, and helped us out with all of our needs. The cottage was clean, modern, and very comfortable. We had two adults, and two kids (6 and 4); the space fit us perfectly. I would highly recommend the cottage for two adults or a small family. We have no complaints at all."
22205817,224645044,,163341574,Yingjie,The house is new and comfortable. .The bed in the bedroom was comfortable. I really like this house.
44170007,653561466,,163517362,Cynthia,"You get exactly what you see in the photos: a clean, simply furnished bedroom with an open and beautiful shared kitchen space. The bathroom was my favorite part! The shower has great water pressure. The location was perfect. Located out of the city but close enough to visit whenever you’d like to enjoy the city life."
24151151,259263175,,163726118,Clorinda,"Very clean, comfortable and spacious! Would definitely recommend for someone who wants to visit the city but doesn't necessarily want to stay in the hustle and bustle of everything. We were gone pretty much all day everyday exploring the city so we only slept here (very comfortable bed and comforter)- but there also was a full kitchen, bathroom, laundry for use if needed. They even had a large screen tv and a fireplace which were definitely an added bonus! Loved the small touches they made to make this place feel like a home- cute decor, supplies in kitchen, plants etc."
37629139,510874804,,163768268,Tk,"Most beautiful home I've ever stayed at on Airbnb! Loved the barn door, large sectional couch and TV, live edge dining table and huge kitchen. We were all super impressed with the designer decor and furnishing which all seemed brand new; all 5 queen beds were plush and luxurious and we all had a fantastic night of sleep. Super clean home and extremely convenient location right next to a nice park, only a short <$8 Uber ride to Pike and downtown, and lots of great restaurants within walking distance at the 23rd/Jackson junction and International District. The free driveway and roadside parking was a bonus. We also LOVED the backyard which had ample seating for our large group and berries/grapes for the picking plus a legit firepit. Sherry was responsive and check in was a breeze, can't recommend Sherry's home enough and can't wait to visit again!"
11069945,68242172,,16383998,Jardar,"The neighbourhood was very nice, near to the University of Washington, and relatively near to a nice grocery store (a few blocks north). The host was easily accessible, and made sure I knew where everything was and what I could use. The apartment was very clean, uncluttered and tidy. It is a basement apartment, so the lighting from the windows is limited; the windows are fairly large so though indirect light, one does get some light."

37936390,522206199,,164486140,Robbyn,"Guy’s place is a true charm. Walking through the garden to your tiny home was such a treat. The space is roomy for 2 and so comfortable. Lovely little touches made it seem so homey. The weather was perfect when we visited and letting the cool breeze waft through was delightful. The neighborhood is adorable with a decent amount to see and do nearby. Guy, an excellent communicator and beyond accommodating will definitely see me again if I make my way to that area!"

The hosts were very helpful and made sure we had everything we needed for the stay. The house is very well equipped and extremely comfortable. I would definitely stay again on my next visit to Seattle.
4432489,24453401,,16516540,Xueting,"It is really a great and very very clean house, we have all the basement all by ourselves, and there is no noise at all. We have everything we need, walk-in closet, clean bathroom, fully equipped kitchen, and fast speed internet. The house is close to Washington Lake, I can walk to the lake, and watch the view, it was very nice. Cathy and her family are very friendly and helpful, they provided us all the information we need, and prepared us some snacks before we arriving, thank you Cathy. Oh, by the way, if you just want to visit Seattle downtown, you don't need rent a car, there are buses go there. And thanks Lila providing us ride! We enjoy leaving here!!!"
9694921,58079217,,1651755,Katherine,"Great experience staying in this wonderful home!<br/><br/>1) Fantastic location in Westlake - I could get to the 5, any part of downtown Seattle, Fremont, etc within five minutes any direction. Also very close to the big tech presence, took me less than five minutes to head into the office.<br/><br/>2) Neighborhood is friendly, lots of people walking around, especially with dogs.<br/><br/>3) House is gorgeous - usually when I think ""historic"" houses I think of very old, kind of run down homes but this one is anything but - it has all the charm of an older home - beautiful doorways, large rustic kitchen that you see on those house remodelling shows as the ""after"", clawfoot bathtub, etc - and none of the old home-ness. <br/><br/>4) Hosts were great - available via message whenever I had a question and made us feel very welcome. Left us coffee as a treat.<br/><br/>5) Dog friendly - front yard has decent patch of grass, backyard is closed off (no grass right now in the back)."
34535666,464466582,,165208166,Matt,Very kind and hospitable host.
50010405,765199078,,165252403,Nick,"Great location in Fremont, lots of restaurants and parks nearby. Hosts were quite friendly, attentive, and communicative. Clean, chic room in a nice modern house's basement with a decently comfortable king size bed and some kitchen amenities including a fridge, microwave, and dish ware - but no kitchenette, so plan on checking out the many restaurants nearby rather than cooking in. The two separate suites are fairly well soundproofed from one another. Rainfall shower head is awesome - make sure to use the bathmat they provide you, as the floors are quite slick when wet. Overall, an excellent experience and an absolute bargain at the price!"
2950213,14212914,,16529566,Michelle,"This was a fantastic place in an excellent neighborhood, exactly as advertised. Walking distance to great restuarants and fun pubs, very quiet and neat. Easy taxi rides downtown. Overall an excellent experience. Highly recommend this place if you are looking for a cool place to hang in Seattle, without having to deal with downtown."
3269390,14646413,,16547040,Anna,"Diane is a wonderful host and was extremely accommodating, our flight came in late and she was more than happy to work with us. The cottage itself was beautiful and well maintained and the neighborhood was very safe. We would not hesitate to stay here again whenever we're in Seattle."

22332853,229297905,,165890409,Jasmine,Great little space in Seattle! Had everything you’d need to have a comfortable stay while also being very close to the city and UW.

19770172,173737040,,16643533,K.,"Kelley's apartment was an amazing place to stay for our first visit to Seattle and she was a great host. Some things that we loved about the stay:<br/>- Kelley was very responsive, helpful, and kind. She is very respectful of privacy, yet available if you need her. <br/>- The apartment is close to downtown, but tucked in a residential neighborhood and has a ""homey"" feel. Its very close to the beach, grocery, and many other conveniences.<br/>- We had access to a fully stocked kitchen (oven, microwave, stove, tools, etc.) and washer/dryer. <br/>- The apartment was very clean!<br/>- There is a private bedroom and bathroom within the apartment stocked with everything you might need (iron, towels, blankets, etc.)<br/>- The apartment has its own private entrance, separate from the main home above, creating a private space with easy access. <br/>Overall, it was a very comfortable and enjoyable stay. We'd can't wait to visit again!"
21702555,226273334,,166451831,Erin,"What a fantastic place to stay! Clean and comfortable! Paige has thought of everything - the unit was stocked with all the basics and then some! Easy to find parking, and great coffee shops and restaurants within walking distance. We will be back and highly recommend to anyone looking for a place to stay in Seattle!"
9419,71022,,166478,Beth,"If you love art, animals, and yoga, this is the place for you. My niece was visiting me in Portland from Springfield MO and had never been to Seattle before. I found this site by accident while looking for a place to stay. <br/>Angielena Chamberlain is a very cool and talented hostess. We shared her wonderful art studio with her, 4 rescue cats, and an adorable Jack Russell Terrier. The room was small and quaint with a comfortable feather bed. There were towels and fluffy bathrobes laid out for us to use. <br/>For those of you who like something artsy and not overrun with tourist, you will love the Georgetown area. <br/>And...if you want to go downtown, the 106 bus will get you straight to all the downtown Seattle usuals such as Pike's Market. The 106 will also get you straight to and from the Amtrak station. When we arrived late at night, it was so great that the bus went from the Amtrak station to just 2 doors down to Angielena's door! No car needed!<br/>If you don't mind sharing a little space, this is a great place to stay with an amazing hostess. I highly recommend this and hope to stay again on my next trip to the area!<br/>"
49462042,755936135,,166784617,Phillip,Scott was super friendly in passing but was sure to give me total privacy during my stay. Perfect for a quick business trip. Scott provided extensive kitchen supplies and you can’t beat the location.
45787759,709783423,,166788069,Chad,"The place is new, clean, and has everything needed. The reason why I gave it a low score is because the owners made me have 2 cleanings of the place (not through Airbnb) while I was staying there, and expected me to pay for it out of pocket. These cleanings included both a cleaner person and the owner coming into the place. During these ""cleanings"" the owner seemed to be inspecting the place to see if I had damaged it or done something wrong. Inspecting small things and ""scolding"" me if I had done something wrong. I did not want these cleanings and wanted to be left alone, yet they told me it was required. It felt like a complete invasion of privacy. I wanted to stay longer because I liked the place, but I just couldn't take being made so uncomfortable."
33717205,436301967,,166807039,Sky,Very helpful hosts
1764100,8180643,,1669484,Irina,"Super convenient location and a great quiet, private apartment, just as described. Melissa is easily accessible and readily available to help. The only drawback if you have a car is that free parking is about a 5-10 minute walk from the house.<br/>On the other hand, you have practically every bus in Seattle practically at your doorstep, not to mention all the food choices."
52170700,4.83E+17,,167058723,Alex,"Irmgard's place was a perfect start to my time in Seattle. It had everything you needed and was within walking distance to the Ballard Farmer's Market, Target, and other stores. She is quick to respond if you need anything. Her place is cozy and she includes many personal touches which makes the stay even more special. Would definitely recommend."
46647161,726235852,,167387659,Nancy,"Beata's place is the perfect location in West Seattle. It is spacious, charming and clean. Everything you need to cook and clean. The beds are comfortable. The fireplace is a gorgeous touch. The back patio area is cute. This Airbnb is really special. I will stay here again anytime it is available when visiting Seattle!"
22639064,239200900,,167484933,Christine,"This place exceeded our expectations! The view of the city, the location & the place being well stocked with the basics made our stay memorable & simple. This is a new and well kept place. Highly recommend."

30426117,357602604,,167619782,Justus,"GREAT EXPERIENCE!<br/>This was my first stay with Airbnb, so I was a bit nervous, but Andrew was a great host.<br/>Very friendly, and had great tips for sights to see and things to do in the city and neighborhood. His family even cooked me dinner, twice! (delicious btw)<br/>During my stay he checked in periodically to make sure I had everything I needed, kept the fridge stocked with water and some beverages, and some easy to prepare food and fruit was available as well. Coffee was made every morning by the time I woke up. <br/>The bathroom had all the toiletries I needed and was spotless (good quality shampoo and conditioner)<br/>The washer and dryer were nice, the other appliances as well. <br/>Big TV in the living room with Netflix and Chromecast to screen cast from phone. <br/>Bed was comfy too. <br/>Everything I needed and more was available. <br/>I really didn't want to leave haha. <br/>The experience all around was very positive and I will absolutely try to stay here again when I visit.<br/>-Thanks Andrew! You are your family were great!"
41683969,641188567,,168286915,Solomon,"The place is great. Brand new just remodeled. Lots of the stuff in kelitchen still in new package.<br/>The kichen has a great GE microwave, oven and 5 burner powerful gas stove. A joy to cook with.<br/>The owner is very nice and responsive. Very helpful and considerate. We communicated well with the Airbnb messaging."
30578185,360751680,,16831057,Natalie,"This apartment is really nice and in a very upscale neighborhood. The house is cozy and very charming with a full kitchen, a dining area with a nice view and a living room that's very comfortable to lounge around and relax in. Large bathroom and nice shower. The bedroom is on the top floor and it's very secluded and quiet. Plenty of street parking if you have a car. Nice patio area with BBQ to hang out in if it were warmer out. The home was clean and well equipped. Dave is a really nice host and very helpful. I'd definitely stay here again!<br/>Great place to stay if visiting Seattle as this home is steps away from a really good pizza place, two coffee shops, a donut shop and an ice cream shop. It's a few blocks from the main shopping street in this neighborhood that has an amazing choice of restaurants. Two grocery stores are nearby (Safeway and Trader Joe's). Close to bus that goes direct to downtown Seattle."
26804995,294213975,,16839313,Cristina,"Mike's place was great for my short stay in the city. The central Belltown location made it easy to go all over the place. Many buses are 2 blocks away. A Lyft shares from cap. Hill was <$5. There are also plenty of things to do right in the area. The space itself is clean, bright and private. The shower worked great. Plenty of kitchen space. I slept really well. Friday night had the neighborhood packed with clubgoers etc. If city noise bothers you, you may want to consider that before booking a wknd, if you need quiet to sleep. Appreciated the easy check in, and thoughtful coupons for nearby cafes. Wifi worked great! Also Starbucks is right next door!"
34504826,469499823,,168446361,Austin,We drove to Seattle with absolutely no idea what we were doing/where anything was. We got very lucky by being able to stay with Mary Jo. The Airbnb is perfectly located and the backyard is immaculate. 10/10 recommend
15159094,107681641,,16863059,Ben,Paula and Dave could not have been nicer or more focused on making our family's stay absolutely perfect while in Seattle. The apartment was so cute and comfortable and it was the perfect fit for our family. We had plenty of room to spread out and we loved having coffee on the patio in the morning with views of the lake and mountains. Can't wait to come back for another great visit.
28521122,357271528,,168658718,Christiane,The home was wonderful.
12868418,79802509,,16885781,Cyndy,Doug is a fantastic host and wants your trip and stay to be awesome. He took time to make sure we had what we needed for my son's graduation weekend. The house is in a great location in the Ballard area and was large enough with room to spare for six of us and at a great price. We were able to cook meals and had space to play games and just hang out. Doug had cable tv and WiFi so we were able to follow favorite sports and finish preparing for a trip. Doug took time to communicate with us the rules of the house and neighborhood upfront to make our stay easy. Thank you Doug -- would stay again in a heartbeat.
29032817,365758205,,168871,Junko,"What a beautiful home! Well-established neighborhood, and not far from park, coffee shops, and supermarkets. The house is beautifully appointed, and the hosts had added lovely touches of fresh flowers to make it feel welcoming. The main floor with an eat-in kitchen had a professional oven/stove, and the kitchen was well equipped for preparing family meals. In the mornings, you could see birds outside and enjoy the fresh air through the French doors in the kitchen. While we initially thought the dining room table was small, the round shape allowed our entire family of seven to sit around it at the same time. The living room has comfortable seating and easily fits the entire family, and we spent many happy hours putting together puzzles and talking and laughing. There's also a spacious half-bath conveniently adjacent to the kitchen and hallway. Upstairs, there is a bedroom for two and a children's suite uniquely designed with a large play area in the center and small alcove rooms on two sides for sleeping -- one with a twin bed and the other with small bunk beds. There's also a spacious bathroom with a beautiful tub and two sinks as well as the toilet. In the basement, there's an ""in-laws' suite"" that functions as a completely separate living space. The main bedroom sleeps two, and has French doors leading outside to a lovely private sitting area. There's a twin bed in the study, and a bathroom with a luxurious shower. The sitting area in the basement has a couch and chairs so you can have another visiting area as well, and a small bar with a coffee maker. All the beds were comfortable (so everyone reported), and the bedding of nice, fresh quality. What this house offers is a lovely place for an extended family or a group of friends to enjoy time together. Our hosts were very responsive, immediately available for answering any questions, and enormously hospitable -- they even made sure that the chemically fragranced air fresheners were all removed and provided hypoallergenic toiletries because many members of our family have allergies. All in all, an excellent airbnb and a place I'd love to return to stay in again. Highly recommended."
44479137,756863186,,1691819,Venecia,Lovely place to stay in the best neighborhood! Kelly and her family are so very sweet.

3158243,14843556,,16921199,Vincent,"The location is convenient to the University of Washington and to University Village. The apartment was clean, the bed comfortable, and the bedroom was quiet. Melissa was accommodating on arrival and departure times. I would not hesitate to stay there again."

2215336,16111884,,16942779,Liz,"Everything was great. The house was really nice and in a very cute neighborhood. Coordinating/check-in/etc. was all very smooth and easy. I didn't get to meet Kelly, but our friends (that stayed there) did and said that she was really nice and friendly. Thanks!"

36236107,596107013,,169517523,Faith,Super nice. I’d stay again
35360184,494167295,,169539703,Mara,"A nice and quiet location (except during the day since there is a house being built next door, but no early start and ended at a reasonable time, and no weekend work - so, all in all no big deal) for a visit to Seattle. The place is simple and has all you need for a comfortable stay. I’d definitely recommend!!"
50956836,5.08E+17,,169585364,Conner,"I stayed here for a month after moving here for a job. Jim was great. He responded right away whenever I had a question and was always super friendly with anything I needed, even just questions about Seattle in general. The place was exactly what I needed. I worked from there three days a week and never had an issue with WiFi. You share a driveway with the other unit and they are super friendly. There’s also street parking but it’s just nice to have a driveway and not having to worry about it. Clean and had everything I needed for the month. Location was great, incredibly close drive to literally anything I needed but could also walk or ride a bike if you wanted to. Also had multiple streaming services which is always a plus (:"
33776522,454660234,,169598416,Jessica,This location is very clean and modern and right of the freeway. Would definitely go back!
28414569,327461099,,169615547,Flannery,"This was my first time in Seattle and first time using Airbnb, and it couldn’t have been a more pleasant experience. The cottage is private with it’s own entrance, and I could come and go without calling attention to myself. The cottage itself is cozy and cheerful. The host provided a number of snacks that could be eaten on the go or prepared in the microwave. Everything was sparkling clean, the bed and pillows were comfortable and inviting, and everything down to the shower soap was thoughtfully prepared. I’m absolutely in love with Seattle after this trip and am looking forward to returning. Laurelhurst Cottage sets a high standard for all other Airbnb rentals."
21933426,235187446,,169764813,Andrew,"The cabin was cozy and rustic, and conveniently located to Alki beach. It was a surprise to find a cabin hidden away in the city! We enjoyed disappearing into the trees and hear the sea lions barking in the distance. The working antique wood-fired stove was prepped with firewood to burn, and it made the whole cabin experience very authentic. Enjoyed a romantic wooded getaway with my sweetheart."
13155310,77599914,,16978826,Willow,"Our experience at the place was wonderful. Everything is neat and well equipped, and we enjoyed the wine provided for us. Definitely worth staying here again!"
3303376,15072591,,16995771,Eric,"Georgetown is a fascinating little neighbourhood. The Mexican and pizzaria provided some of the best meals ever... at VERY reasonable rates. Old buildings are great. local coffee shop, musix bar, pinball shop, etc. And the weekend market; trailler full of mysteries! Definetly worth exploring this neighbourhood. The actual place you will stay at is basic but great (especially the red barry white). 2 noteworthy aspects though: the building is quiet, but the airport near by is not (not a problem for me, but might be for some as planes past near by), and get to know the bus system (including the tunnels). Bonus, Angielena was very accomodating!"

22734794,232370676,,170297000,Mark,"I participated in a weekend event at the Landmark Worldwide Seattle office. The location was perfect, 9 minute walk. The unit was very conferrable and had everything I needed to stay for the long weekend. This will definitely be the location of choice for all future logging needs!"
36212774,507681746,,170392526,Rebeca,Awesome little place to stay. It has everything you need and is super clean and cute.
49587954,770166842,,170609036,Dee,Emily has a very pleasant hope. My friends and I were in awe of the beautiful backyard. The house is tastefully decorated and very cozy. Very close by to attractions in the city.
7075948,44797937,,17068845,Akhbar,Great townhouse in Seattle! Everything you need to have a very comfortable stay.
23001080,231993897,,17088298,Jacob,"Ryan and Dustin were super friendly and accommodating when I booked with them extremely last minute. Their home is immaculate (not an exaggeration) throughout their house the rooms were bright, tastefully decorated and included Alexa digital voice assistant for convenience. I was pleasantly surprised to find the room to be better than I expected. I tend to over pack so I was grateful for the room's large closet, that includes hangers and the tall dresser. The private bathroom, which is designated to you for the duration of your stay, is another great touch, it was modern, spotless and they provided all the shower necessities. Though I stuck to ice water I was given full access to the kitchen and told I was welcome to anything in the fridge. I'm bias because I have a Boston terrier myself but their dog, named Boston, was friendly, adorable and well mannered. I'm very satisfied with my stay and the level of hospitality shown by Ryan and Dustin who made it clear my stay was a priority to them."
29103244,338891470,,171282262,Nina,"This apartment is great and the host is fantastic, quickly responding and arranging all the possible amenities that made my life really enjoyable in the apartment. The apartment is spot clean with great bed and facilities, especially the fireplace won me over by providing extra comfort on the relatively cold October day. Not to mention a very a thoughtful little thing of the host of providing a coupon for a drink in a nearby coffee shop. I would ALWAYS go back to that place!"
53834727,5.57E+17,,17132322,Vikas,"Dawn is a wonderful host! She is truly accommodating and will make sure you have an amazing stay! The cottage is a gem with a peaceful zen setup. The bed was super comfy and relaxing. Dawn has also provided fresh eggs for breakfast from their chickens, my kids loved it. very nice place if you have pets, our dog enjoyed the backyard as much as we did.<br/>Even though it is a cottage, she has everything you need to cook simple meals. The shower is great and has good water pressure!<br/>We also loved the zen-like backyard outside. It’s a perfect setting for relaxing and was peaceful! <br/>The location was great! You are down the street from a lot of grocery stores, foods, and bars. We loved our stay and can’t wait to come back! This cottage along with Dawn's beautiful hospitality also provided us with all that we could have hoped for in Seattle!<br/>Thanks Dawn!"
7087957,38966368,,1713611,Mark,"Fantastic location in the heart of Capitol Hill. The floorplan is like that of a hotel with a nice kitchen nook and an authentic, Seattle vibe. Craig greeted us when we arrived and gave clear instructions that made our stay even more pleasant. I'd stay here again when I find myself in Seattle next."
33295396,6.52E+17,,171366099,Laurel,"Wow!<br/>Ben's quaint place was perfect.<br/>1) The room was peaceful and quiet. The bed was comfortable, the pillows had substance.<br/>2) The location is close to Pike Place Market, downtown Seattle, Mariner/Seahawk game sites, I-5, and I-90 freeways.<br/>3) Ben is very accommodating. Offered transportation. Then, after hearing my boyfriend's seafood cravings, a dinner was presented. Wood smoked coho salmon, fresh asparagus, & lightly buttered rice, garnished with toasted almonds. Gourmet. Delicious. <br/>Ben's place and Ben = great vibes!"

22904624,233470964,,172245775,Jose,"This had a private entrance and private rooms. The bathrooms were nice, hot hot water and good water pressure. Towels, soap, shampoo, and conditioner were provided. Chocolates and fresh flowers were in the room. Automatic lights when walking down the hall and a small but full kitchen. It was a nice place to stay! And the location was perfect!"

41819916,600065399,,172930891,Jessica,What an amazing find! The location can’t be beat!! Right by the water with quick and easy access to all of the essentials. There is PLENTY of space to stretch out in and the hosts were SPECTACULAR! They have really put so much thought into the details that made our temporary stay feel like home. Be sure to make use of the record player if you stay here!

3385421,16122911,,17303976,Michelle,"The unit was clean and spacious- Ken really made the check-in/check-out process smooth. The condo was comfortable, the amenities were great, and the centralized downtown distance and being right across from the Pike Place Market made it all the more worth it!"
5.58E+17,6.32E+17,,173125792,Jennifer,It’s a beautiful stay and the outside space is such a treat in the hustle and bustle of the city! Beacon hill is a cute area with lots of food and activities close by! Malcom and him partner were great hosts very attentive and quick to help with anything I needed. Just a heads up this is a downstairs apartment - so you can hear things from up stairs. If you like to sleep in or during the day just something to be aware of. I would recommend staying here. It was delightful!
25490529,285812127,,173370276,Dj,"A lovely studio located in the lively and scenic Madrona. Full of amenities, and with a helpful and gracious host, I could not recommend this place more."
28471944,337230139,,173426914,Katie,"This place is absolutely perfect for anyone traveling to Seattle! Alice went above and beyond my expectations with the space and thought about providing necessities that I hadn't even thought of. She gave me a tour of the unit/building upon check-in and was completely available/responsive throughout my stay. Parking is included which is HUGE, especially in Belltown. There is also a washer/dryer in unit. The location is perfect and the apartment complex is extremely clean and safe. There is a pool, hot tub and workout facility in the building. The unit was impeccably clean and obviously well-maintained. I would stay here again in a heartbeat! I can't say how enough how amazing my experience was!"
11047227,79508269,,17345671,Leily,"We were happy to be Carrie's inaugural guests. The space is an in-law unit underneath the house. It is very comfortable and clean! Many amenities available and great communication with Carrie who made some extra touches to make our experience truly special.<br/> The neighborhood is a sweet, family oriented environment with great views of the lake and the Bellevue area. Shops and restaurants in walking distance and access to public transit."

49316920,761767272,,17370155,Chanel,Beautiful house and front and back yards! We enjoyed watching a baby bunny in the garden and biking down to the tide pools at Lowman Beach park at the bottom of the hill. The kitchen is very well stocked. The house is comfortable and clean. The hosts were prompt and responsive to our questions. The bathroom is accessible only via one of the bedrooms. Highly recommended!
14708936,99274095,,1737425,Meaghan,"Sampa was a very nice host, especially considering that my visit was very last-second-I was just looking for a place to crash with a comfortable bed and maybe some coffee, and I got both! I think as a brand-new listing, there are definitely some kinks to be worked out."
5.85E+17,6.08E+17,,173863041,Alma,this place is perfect for a family with dogs! yard is fenced except for one small spot at the entrance where a dog can get under so I would say watch your animals close and keep them towards the back to run off leash safely. it's simple and close to big cities activities parking is included which is a big expense at a Seattle hotel. be ready to enjoy your company as entertainment is wifi only. it's close to food delivery and public transportation actually stops right in front of the house. it's such a blessing to have reasonable prices that allows pets.
41599876,608111979,,173899423,Ryan,Nice and clean
32474278,424452539,,173957228,Brett,"If Blue Haven is available, you should definitely book it for the perfect place to stay in the heart of Seattle with beautiful waterfront views. The roomy place is smartly appointed with recent furnishings to make you feel right at home. Arrival instructions were very detailed and easy to follow; Bindu greeted us at our agreed upon arrival time, but we were confident it wasn't necessary.<br/>Bindu thought of everything: the kitchen is well provisioned with any tools you may need if you choose to cook, though we ate out at the many restaurants that are in walking distance from the flat. There is a tea kettle, two coffee makers, a Keurig for which she provided a variety of pods, and a traditional coffee maker for folks like us who prefer to brew coffee we purchased at the Starbucks a block away. We appreciated the spattering of games and books (one of which my wife somehow found the time to devour while we were there) which was a very nice touch.<br/>The patio is a nice place to enjoy your morning brew while watching the ferries make their way back and forth across the sound. Our teen aged girls enjoyed the privacy of their own room with twin beds where they could retreat after a long day of exploring while my wife and I enjoyed the evenings chatting in the living room. <br/>While there is an elevator, we appreciated that the flat is conveniently located next to a stairwell with direct access to the street and the parking garage one level below. You simply cannot beat the location. We left the car in the garage the four days we were there and explored the city afoot. There are shuttles along the Waterfront and the Monorail stop is just a few blocks to the east and a fun way to get to Seattle Center where we enjoyed the Chihuly Gardens and Space Needle. <br/>During our stay, Bindu kept in contact, making sure everything was OK and offering suggestions for things not to miss. She was unobtrusive but always available. Perfect."
20883221,240455139,,174044211,Christian,"Darcy's place was incredible. The attention to detail in every single room was awesome! The place is insanely stylish and vintage, we stayed for my girlfriends birthday and she loved it. There was even a bottle of wine, cupcakes, and croissants waiting for us. I would love to stay here again!"
9.06E+17,9.63E+17,,1743467,Acy,"David's place is in a great location and the interior is as advertised. The check in/out was really easy. The mattress was a bit small for two of us, and not particularly comfortable, but other than that everything was smooth."
45833019,717465834,,174484443,Kelly,"I wish I could've given this place 5 stars, but unfortunately there was one big thing I had an issue with: the wifi. It was advertised that the wifi was fast enough to do web browsing and even stream. When I booked, I got a message saying that the wifi was not great for streaming but was good for general web browsing. That also proved to be false and I had quite a few connectivity issues. And unfortunately to a young professional, Internet access is important.<br/>However, the rest of the place was lovely. It was very spacious for a single person and for an extended stay, it was great to have storage space. Though neither of the mattresses (either on the bed or the futon) are exceptionally comfortable, they are adequate and the linens provided were fresh and the towels were new. Daniel, the host, was very friendly and responsive. He had many suggestions for how to get around the area and sights to see. The location was the best part--in a quiet and safe neighborhood, just down the block from a nice park. It's close to downtown and hopping on the freeway is incredibly easy and convenient. There are a few eateries within walking distance and the views on the water are nice even when the weather isn't. <br/>Overall, I enjoyed my stay here and would certainly recommend it for a shorter stay!"
36114524,530506181,,174592608,Sarah,"We had a great stay at Rebecca’s. We were in the area for Mariners games and her place was an easy and relatively short trip to the ballpark. Easy check in, cute decor, clean and beds are comfortable. We would stay here again."
27602783,323477431,,174663974,Carolina,"Marc and Sherry have gone above and beyond to make our stay comfortable. The house includes everything you could ever need and more. The house is big, clean, has a great yard, and is located in a very convenient spot. Will make sure to book Eureka next time I'm in Seattle."
32902443,547690880,,174725338,David,"Great place across the street from the Sound. Very close to Pike's Place Market, tons of restaurants and entertainment. Lindsay is a great host and the condo is very comfortable. Parking is an awesome plus, too."
49515708,765717604,,17474127,Namie,"My husband and I had the most amazing vacation in Seattle and the 5 days we spent at Carla’s home played a big role!<br/>The home is decorated with a beautifully fun and modern style and we felt it was extremely clean! There are luxury touches everywhere (heated bathroom tiles, top level appliances). The bed was amazing and I had really good sleep to start each day! <br/>We absolutely loved the outdoor upper level deck and utilized it multiple times to relax with some drinks and unwind.<br/>Carla is also a very responsive host and easy to communicate with! Thanks Carla for the wonderful stay!"
23469069,241328661,,174755024,Rusty,This place is just as advertised. I was concerned about parking but found it no problem at all. Would stay again.
33619584,622316098,,174757559,Stephen,Expect a very thorough experience. Daniel doesn't miss any detail. Awesome experience.
42695194,625760157,,174985955,Brigid,"Great location for beach, restaurants, shops. Place is very comfortable and clean. Great hosts!"
15975033,242685930,,175125805,Rita,My first time with Beth n Jon. Love them. Always there when I needed them and helpful. They made it hard for me to want to leave. The best stay ever.
36111871,670588215,,175336434,Melissa,"Super cute place in a great location. Lobby is fun and colorful. AMAZING bedding and we loved the jetted tub. Extremely accommodating staff. Would go back, 10/10!"
3818746,25500978,,17555132,Jaime,Beautiful home. Stunning views and comfy beds. Really enjoyed the morning sunrise with a cup of coffee and the fireplace going. So relaxing. We really enjoyed the open layout of living area and kitchen. We cooked all of our meals at the home and it was nice to still visit and cook at the same time without feeling excluded in a kitchen. I plan on making a lot of trips to Seattle now that I have a niece on the way and I hope the house is available every trip. Wonderful trip wonderful memories. Thank you.
22453792,243635827,,175587245,Eddie,Place is quiet and super clean. Home was well organized with expectations and amenities. Definitely recommend to anyone traveling in the area.
21501822,223758734,,1757185,Shana,"Great location—Townhouse is tucked away in a quiet area but still walking distance to bars, restaurants, and lively Capitol Hill. There’s a coffee shop on the corner and groceries very close. Plenty of space, lots of handy kitchen things available, host was conveniently nearby in case of questions or issues (though we didn’t have any)"
370361,1075385,,1757208,Colleen,Sheldon is a kind and generous host. The studio is very nice and clean in a quiet neighborhood. The queen bed was very comfortable and we had a great night's sleep. We enjoyed being able to walk to a grocery store and local coffee shops. Ken's Market has everything you'd need. Sheldon's sightseeing and dining recommendations were excellent. He took the time to print out information on things to do and places to go in the area. We would certainly stay here the next time we are in Seattle.
27334813,317187728,,176149997,Jennifer,Thank you so much for your hospitality! Your views are gorgeous. The boys had fun in the man cave downstairs playing games all night. Just one night was definitely too short. We plan on returning for a longer stay. There was more than enough room for our two families together. And all the goodies in the kitchen really hit the spot. Love love love this place! Very thoughtful touches.
21381109,220311196,,17620840,Phil,This place was great. Lots of amenities. Seems like they only rent it out when they are out of town.
29979422,357598181,,17624268,Vito,Great place and great location. Short walk to a few good food spots and a slightly longer walk (or short drive) to everything else in Ballard. Easy check in and great communication with the hosts before and during our stay.
47919660,6.59E+17,,176282523,Madalyn,Great location and amenities! Will definitely stay again if in the area.
21213854,242364344,,176861950,Amreet,"This place far exceeded our expectations! Amy went above and beyond to make us feel comfortable and welcome. Such a spacious suite with a fully stocked kitchen, bathroom, 2 big bedrooms, and a living room with a game console and multiple new games and movies! The house is also right in front of a lake and park with a beautiful view. Would HIGHLY recommend this place to anyone who's visiting Seattle!"
34978518,468126044,,177015611,Alex,"Thomas is an excellent host, who is responsive and thoughtful of your needs. It was my family and I's first ever trip to Washington/Seattle, and we were very happy with Thomas's accommodations. The location is very close to the heart of downtown Seattle and all of its sights by car. Speaking of which, the unit offers a private parking area away from any busy streets. It's tucked away, which made me feel very safe about our rental car. Within walking distance to the unit is a very excellent bakery, which we took advantage of getting fresh bread and pastries for breakfast everyday.<br/>The unit itself is cozy, simple yet comfortable, and had what we needed for our extended stay in terms of dishware and silverware. There are TWO patio areas that you can sit outside and enjoy the scenery and weather with your cup of coffee. The beds had plenty of sheets and pillows to accommodate any type of sleeper. Thomas is very respectful of your privacy, so you may not see him around for long stretches of time. But if you need anything, he is very quick to respond either by message or in person. All in all, my family and I enjoyed our time there and would definitely stay there again if we found ourselves back in Seattle."
4324917,26944152,,177045,Anya,My daughter and I stayed in the Cozy Bedroom for 1 night at the very end of a college tour. Ralph met us when we arrived. He and his wife were friendly and welcoming. They were very helpful with everything we needed. The place was as described and we felt very comfortable.
21457914,211858163,,17725853,Mark,"This property is located in a perfect location for those visiting the UW. There is a separate entrance to the apartment, everything is new and clean. Mary was very responsive and answered all the questions I had, and quickly addressed all my requests. To summarize, highly recommended!"
24473699,272608322,,17730208,Sarah,"Brianne’s place was so adorable! Super clean, stylish, and cozy. I highly recommend staying here, I can’t wait to return. She was very quick to respond and super helpful!!!"
35204718,463020759,,17740667,C,"This home is in a lovely scenic neighborhood. The host was very quick with communication and the home was sparkling clean, quiet, and comfortable. I will definitely stay here again when I am in the area."
41539137,601159326,,177407831,Ekram,Best place and amazing hostess!
1097520,4669480,,1774671,Shellie-Ann,"Bill and I were Jeanie's first guests. We enjoyed our stay at her apartment very much. We were in close proximity to Lake Washington and all the great dining options in Colombia City were just a few minutes away. It was very easy to access downtown, Seattle from Jeanie's place. Although we drove the light rail and bus lines were in very close proximity and would have been easy to use. The apartment is very nicely decorated and the bed is super comfortable. We also appreciated the heated bathroom floors."
22816524,246107283,,177576574,Carlo,"This is a very clean and comfortable space. Very welcoming upon entry, while also providing some privacy if you need it. I liked the small, personal touches from the travel photography on the walls, books and board games, and their guidebook to the area.<br/>Marcy and Scott both had quick text responses to any questions or requests I had. They’re very accommodating, even offering a place to lock my bike and a pump when my tire was flat. <br/>The kitchen had pretty much everything you could need for cooking, and Trader Joes is a convenient 5 minute drive away. The only thing that was a little confusing were the symbols on the microwave (I just Googled it, but I’m sure Marcy and Scott would have helped if I asked). <br/>If you’re not into cooking, there are a number of restaurants within walking distance in the Central district. <br/>Location wise, it’s on a quiet street just 10-15 minute drive from most Seattle sites like Safeco and Century Link Fields, Pike Place Market and the Space needle, etc. It’s about a 30 minute walk to downtown if you’re into getting exercise on the many Seattle hills. It might not be for you if you prefer being right in downtown, but I actually prefer that it feels like a little getaway. <br/>This was my first AirBnB experience, and I set a good standard for what I’d look for on the future. I would definitely stay there again."
4113197,21245620,,17764753,Lyn,"Lauren made us feel welcome in a lot of ways- coffee made (unfortunately, I forgot and tried to make tea with coffee water.) The place was spotless and there's a big screen t.v. Unfortunately, the computer crashed in the middle of (75 % through) the Breakfast Club. I managed (by the techno-savvy method of unplug/replug) to get it going again. This was my first time being an AirBnB guest, and it was fun! Lauren's place is stocked with every kind of food/drink you can imagine. We also enjoyed the hot tub! A nice quiet location close to Northgate Mall."
53327630,6.64E+17,,177662300,Christine,"Adorable home in a convenient location! Good food and parks nearby. Very clean and well kept, AC available in two rooms and we loved that there is no tv (but good Wi-Fi!). Our two young kids had a blast coloring in the craft room though we had to help them get up and down the stairs which are a little steep. Cute and quiet back porch. Definitely would stay again!"
37525182,511765546,,177688148,Stanley,Xiaoxi's place is a nice little cozy spot. It is the perfect spot to stay and be close to Downtown Seattle (which is a short 5 to 10 minute ride to popular spots like Pike Place Market; 15 minutes to the Space Needle).
33120365,471606358,,177758903,Katrina,Easy check in and great space! Libby was very responsive and hospitable.
15792703,243658932,,178041787,Andrea,"My daughter and I stayed in the tiny house during a visit from Phoenix. It was everything we were hoping for, with a beachy feel and excellent location. The house was clean and had everything we needed. And Owen and Jenny gave us some great tips on local restaurants and activities to check out. They were very responsive and we will stay here again on our next trip to Seattle!!"
21548484,209646707,,17829099,Mihaela,"Christa’s place was one of the best Airbnb experiences we’ve had. The house is beautiful and quiet. Both the room and the bathroom were very clean and felt equivalent to a nice hotel stay. We were provided towels, reliable wi-fi, and a modern bathroom complete with a coffee brewer! The hosts, Christa and Brian, were both very welcoming. We loved our stay."
3535171,16036757,,17831157,Zach,"I had a wonderful stay at Lynda's place. It's a very cute house in the Greenwood neighborhood with great coffee shops and restaurants right around the corner. Check out Pete's Egg Nest for an amazing breakfast. The setup of Lynda's house allows you to have a private stay which is nice if you need to come and go late at night and you don't want to disturb anyone. The room was clean, comfortable, quiet, and all around relaxing. Beautiful flowers out front as well. I much preferred this stay to ordinary hotels and inns. Lynda was an excellent host and I will definitely be staying again! <br/><br/>Thanks."
22499214,440363917,,178817974,Erika,"Made a trip to seattle last minute, and finding this place was an absolute gem! Great location, easy check in, very clear instructions about how to get there, awesome amenities and quick responses from Jen were an absolute plus for my 2 day trip! One of the best Airbnb’s I’ve ever been! You wont regret staying here!"
41154313,614060913,,1791717,Maria,Absolutely loved the stay! The hosts were very friendly and communicative. The townhome was very clean and quiet as it is off the main road. It truly is in the heart of Capitol Hill as there are so many restaurants just minutes away. The house has so many amenities that I wasn’t expecting…they even had disposable toothbrush which was so great because I forgot mine. The bed was extremely comfortable and the bedding and towels felt very high-end. I highly recommend this airbnb and will definitely stay here again!
40154230,586349803,,179278756,Drew,"Such a cute little place to stay! So cozy, we only stayed for a night but it was wonderful!"
6153532,34911336,,17931672,Brennan,"Tracy is a sweetheart and her place is a wonderful retreat. You'll be in a cottage style accommodation that is separate from the main house. Tons of privacy and a lot of space. I was so, so happy with it. I will definitely try to stay with Tracy again next time I'm in Seattle!"
45942314,707000423,,17934082,Kiana,"Do yourself a favor and book a getaway here! Luke and Marcos’ place on Capitol Hill was such an incredible staycation here in Seattle. Me and my partner and another couple did a “working vacation” in a centrally located spot in Seattle. We were all able to comfortably work remotely with fast internet, great little office nooks. Each night, we were able to cook family dinner in the spacious, fully functional kitchen or order takeout from all the great local restaurants in Capitol Hill. Plus- they have a fire place with wood to make the evenings in extra cozy for movie nights. This spot is tucked in the stunning North Capitol Hill neighborhood, great place to walk around and explore the best parks in the city. And the views! Some of the most epic sunsets in Seattle can be seen right from this spot. The design in the home is modern, clean and homey. Felt like a home away from home with all of the thoughtful details throughout. Such a special experience, especially right here in my hometown! <br/>Luke and Marcos were so sweet, they anticipated all of our need and were incredible responsive. Thanks for making us feel at home!"
31129657,363883302,,179353286,Tyler,Very clean and tidy studio like apartment. All brand new and sparkling clean; I would highly recommend this modern crash pad for anyone cruising through town and is looking for a comfortable place to rest.
2931922,17768598,,17941000,Arjun,"The host was very accomadating in some last minute requests that I had to make. Besides that, the interior is very clean and exterior of the apartment is as nice as any apartment building in the University District is. The neighborhood is very safe and the location is very conveniently located to University Village (shopping mall) which was awesome."
47354247,741608995,,179634919,Erick,Amazing place! Stylish and clean. We really enjoyed it.
40408205,643738709,,179643181,Allison,We stayed at this huge home for 8 nights - it has a beautiful lake view and is centrally located - Only 15 - 20 drive to Pikes Market. Great home!
7886656,44378550,,17972142,Claudia,"The appartment was really nice and had a great view of Seattle. It was very clean and cosy, just few minutes by car from downtown and Alki Beach. We felt very welcome right from the beginning. Joe and Alicia provided helpful advice of what to do in Seattle and were really nice and attentive hosts. @Joe and Alicia: Thanks again for everything. We miss your lovely appartment already!"
3689416,16872521,,17979763,Jon,"My pet and I had a wonderful experience staying with Lauren. The place was very clean and cozy, spa like atmosphere with many amenities. Moreover Lauren was more than a good host and even walked my dog while I was away. I am definitely looking forward to going back!"
14042945,94469055,,18012100,Steve,Everything was great except the neighborhood and especially the outside. Did not know from the listing that it was essentially like a motel. No outside photos posted.
21887859,324792453,,180178848,Will,"The room and common areas of the house, which felt spacious and comfortable, were spotless. The close proximity of Lee's place to the light rail station and tons of delicious Vietnamese food made for a terrific stay. Very good value overall."
22799854,247225389,,180187080,Nate,The space was much nicer than I was expecting and everything was great.
50724974,4.52E+17,,180243059,Raka,"Excellent in every way, our stay was too short. An idyllic location: extremely spacious on the inside and a yard with apples and plum trees with fresh fruit to pick daily just out the front door. Pictures don’t do the home justice! Great for families. Would highly recommend."
31623027,403866574,,180371949,Suhail,The apartment is so cute and relaxing. I came to Seattle as a long weekend visit and had a lot of fun. The owner Julie was very flexible and helpful. I would definitely book the same apartment for the next trip to Seattle ??
19786042,256784150,,180491515,Nguyen,"We love to stay here, it is so comfortable, clean, safety.<br/>Location is perfect, close to everything<br/>The view of all the room are overlooking to the sea and Pike Market...<br/>We are surely comeback! Strongly recommende to everyone!"
14495593,95651627,,1805616,Fridolin,"Very slow communication, very rudimentary equipped (e.g. no cups/glasses), no dining table/chairs. good location though, and clean enough."
6606,5664,,18085,Vivian,"The Urban Cottage is comfortable, beautiful, fun and really convenient! Joyce is an amazing host and super friendly. The Wallingford neighborhood is convenient to outdoor adventures, shopping, relaxation, and to lots of buses to downtown. If you get a chance to stay with Joyce, I highly recommend it! We will definitely be back again!"
25053046,275320270,,181090216,Elizabeth,"Lovely, calm, stylish home in a great neighborhood & city!"
40411891,592784816,,181146132,Katrina,"Ming was readily available for our stay and was very accommodating. If you have a big group coming to Seattle, you’ll love this place."
15456841,115075081,,18122756,Saiichi,What really sells this place is how well everything is the patio and how well everything is tied together. The patio makes such a wonderful experience and the setup inside carries that same experience throughout the whole place. I also really enjoyed the projector and tech the house had to offer.
48031092,754837916,,18161415,Racheal,"The rental was very private with it's own entrance and lower level. My kids (3 yo and 8 mo) felt safe and comfortable in the space! All the amenities for kids (books, pack-n-play, baby bath, etc) were so helpful since we flew into Seattle with just a small bag. Internet was fast for the little work I did on it.<br/>The description of the property was accurate, and Noah & Soraya were so quick to respond any time we messaged them! Great hosts!"
24084594,250342478,,181644585,Katie,"We honestly cannot say enough good things about this place. This sweet little apartment is a perfect, quiet get away. Located in a cute little neighborhood, very close to a few local coffee shops and restaurants right down the road. It is clean, and very cute, well stocked with anything you may need in the kitchen, storage space for hanging clothes if needed. The ladies that own this apartment are so sweet, very approachable, and extremely accommodating. We will certainly stay here again, and would 100% recommend it to anyone!"
7128202,38205560,,18173824,Saran,"The good thing about this place is its location and price, but not much else. It's very close to U. of Washington. The room itself was reasonably clean but the building overall has a strange smell and not the cleanest. The unit was small and had a awkward layout with bathroom next to the kitchen. The host was responsive except for the part that we had to call and text multiple times in order to get the wifi password."
48806775,746230518,,181893990,Courtney,"We had a wonderful stay! The space was comfortable, spacious, and secure. It was great having free locked parking and being so closely located to everything in Seattle. We were able to walk to most attractions. It was great! The kitchen had everything we needed and I appreciated the shampoo and conditioner since I forgot mine. The host was very helpful with recommendations and instructions. I would highly recommend this space and hope to visit again soon."
48097196,6.19E+17,,18208772,Praveen,"Tiffany’s Airbnb is literally why people should rent on Airbnb. Right from the get-go Tif was extremely responsive. She made sure that I had what I needed for my month-long stay. She ordered a few more things to make me comfortable. She was extremely communicative and very cheerful and friendly. I got to meet Tiffany during the week and we hung out over a wine. Immediately she became family! We discussed so much over that conversation and bonded so much. Her partner Mark is also such an amazing soul. Both Tif and Mark went to extra lengths to make sure I was cosy and comfortable in the loft.<br/>As far as the loft goes, it’s so bright and cozy. It has everything you need for a stay - short or long. The induction stove works like magic and the mini fridge is more than sufficient. The apartment is 1 block away from a Walgreens that’s open until midnight. The bus stop is close by and can get you downtown in 30 min. This is a huge lifesaver as the West Seattle bridge is being worked on. The neighborhood has a very beachy, island-type vibe and everything seems slower (in a nice way). Coffee shops, coworking avenues, juice bars and tons of grocery stores are all within walking distance. Tif will be sure to make your stay comfortable!! Book here and you shall not regret!"
49531122,756809825,,182294371,David,Nice apartment. Clean. Great location.
44900179,700456164,,182565067,Hemanth,Terry and Kelly are amazing hosts . They really take care of the guests and make them feel comfortable. I felt like i was at home . Strongly recommend this place !!!
3678718,17732232,,18270648,Janna,We had such a great time staying at this air bnb. The spot was perfect! It really is in the heart of Ballard. It was very easy to find and the hosts were very helpful. Lots of room and a giant kitchen to cook in. We couldn't have asked for anything better.
3679617,16748651,,18279958,Ashley,Melissa was fantastic! We booked this last minute and she was very friendly and accommodating. The place is just like described and in a very safe neighborhood. I will definitely be checking this place out again next time I'm in Seattle!
3505739,16049477,,18280423,Wendy,"The neighborhood was nice, beautiful houses. You can see why residents of West Seattle love living there. The house sits on a busy street, but the living space is quite far away from the street so it's very quite and peaceful. It feels much more remote than it actually is. The view is amazing! The house is nicely decorated. The living area is very spacious. There are big windows looking out over Alki Beach and the sound to the Olympic Mountains and beautiful sunsets. It's a very short walk (5-10 minutes) to the beach and restaurants. You do have to take several steps down from the street to the front door. The host was very helpful and accomodating."
50708463,4.39E+17,,183020135,Nico,Excellent location! Great place to stay and great host! I extended my stay for few more nights as you really feel home to this place. Amenities are way better than a hotel - great value for your money!
7.99E+17,8.14E+17,,1834078,Katie,"Absolutely stunning home - photos do not do it justice. The view of the water is gorgeous and enjoying it while soaking in the private hot tub makes it even better. The kitchen had everything we needed and more. This home is beautifully styled, extremely clean and the perfect location in a quiet neighborhood."
7745196,45526721,,18342445,Hubertus,"Trevor and Emily are wonderful hosts for an absolutely modern and complete apartment in a wonderful neighborhood in Seattle.<br/>They were so caring about us, and we could ask them every question, it was like staying at home, or with good friends.<br/>The accommodation is in a close distance to Seattle, and you can reach downtown with the very good bus system. If you´re not intending for the big city, you´ll find yourself in a nice and cool suburb, hosted by one of the nicest couples to find."
44233744,645348823,,18350373,Ajay,"Great location, new building, modern finishes throughout the unit, including very comfortable beds and couch.<br/>We experienced a few hiccups during our stay since the building is still under construction (e.g., poor WiFi connectivity, front entrance under construction, door codes worked sporadically, elevator did not function during the day of the checkout). <br/>However, Austin (property manager) made sure that all our issues were addressed rapidly, and was in constant touch with us throughout our stay. He setup another WiFi repeater in our apartment to boost our connectivity, and even helped us carry our luggage down 3 flights of stairs since the elevator didn’t work on the last day. He was a fantastic host, and a great asset to the Sonder team.<br/>Once the construction (both interior and exterior) is complete, we will have no hesitation in staying again at this property."
356608,1417995,,1835679,Gerard,"We stayed at St John's Apartment #309 in May-June 2012, which is right in the heart of the Capitol Hill district and just a short ten-minute walk from downtown Seattle. The apartment is located in a lovely old building, right on Pike and there is parking (at a reasonable price) at the back. The apartment was very clean and nicely decorated in lovely traditional rustic colors. There are lots of amenities, including cable TV (in every room!) and a generally fast internet connection. <br/><br/>Our host Mark was a real gentleman and his buddy Johnny (who looks after the apartments) is a real nice guy. Check our Mark's framed photos throughout the building, which add a nice personal touch and gives the whole place a nice feel.<br/>I would definitely return!<br/>Gerard, Deirdre and Jonathan (Dublin, Ireland)"
49229904,763470418,,183707581,Lindsay,This is a lovely home in a great neighborhood! Photos are true to life and the house is beautifully finished. We adored the outdoor space and Carla is very responsive.<br/>We would stay here again!
1494986,7099304,,183992,Lisa,We had a lovely stay at William's apartment. Very romantic. Beautiful private garden with an amazing hot tub. Would reccomend staying here to any and all friends traveling to Seattle. William was very nice and helpful. He had lots of reccomendations for the area. We couldn't have asked for a better place to experience Queen Anne!
24254138,254415511,,184148419,Dyllan,Michael did a great job with inviting me in and taking car of any concerns I had. The place was very clean and cozy. This place exceeded my expectations and I recomend it to anyone visiting Seattle. I will for sure be staying here again if I shall come back to Seattle in the future.
3405896,408593697,,18431095,Lynnette,This is a brand new space. Super stylish and had every amenity needed for a comfortable stay. Conni & Stew are wonderful and experienced hosts. I hope their space is open the next time we visit Seattle.
53662522,6.43E+17,,184666221,Nora,Alex’s place is the perfect location for your Seattle get away! Pike’s market is a few streets away and the space needle is about a 20 minute walk down the road. Being in the heart of downtown made things SUPER enjoyable. Alex did a great job communicating while booking the stay and answering all of my questions! The condo itself is absolutely gorgeous and it kick started vacation on the right foot! 10/10! Would recommend this place to everyone!
23045897,257082797,,184685907,Robert,Victor was an excellent and respectful host.
23705097,277562987,,185389685,Z,"Very good host, very thoughtful . Nice touch . Good luck~~~"
22410639,259327247,,185474247,Anna,"Things I’d want to know if this was my first trip to Seattle: <br/>- This is the perfect house for selfie taking or Instagram photos. <br/> - Darcy is an attentive host who’s wonderful to chat with. She really made us feel right at home! <br/> - Everything is super clean. <br/> - The house is within walking distance to a fun neighborhood with great restaurants. <br/> - This was my first time in Seattle. If it’s also yours and you want to explore a wider area, I’d recommend renting a car while you’re there. We took Uber’s everywhere and that was fine, but clearly we would have spent less if we had a car. <br/> - Shops close at 6p. It’s def more of a night life kind of town."
6.56E+17,7.02E+17,,185867726,Alex,great spot near a great food spot and close to alki
5.8E+17,6.26E+17,,185947824,L.J.,"The place looked exactly how it was photographed in the listing and the decor was on point. It is located in a prime location and was very clean. <br/>I would give 5 stars for this, however, I believe it was freshly painted and the fumes caused me to have a migraine for the majority of the stay. I had a late flight and arrived when the sun was down and I had some difficulty finding the walkway without lighting. Also I had to have toilet tissue delivered. <br/>I would definitely recommend this listing if visiting Seattle."
27107417,410177974,,186310789,Joshua,"Great space! Spacious, comfortable, and fun!"
1246769,5283338,,1864688,Blü Properties,"Wonderful location by Westlake Metro stop and great value for money. Dirk and Jaq were extremely accommodating. Communication was timely, helpful and very efficient. The place itself was spotless with everything we needed for our 2-night stay. Even though I left my watch behind, Jaq kindly offered to mail it back. And left us umbrellas for the rainy Seattle weather. Would highly recommend they lovely apartment and I would definitely stay here again on my future visits."
34690515,458948308,,18651557,Abigail,"Queen Anne's is an awesome, cozy neighborhood with beautiful gardens. It is very close to all the coffee shops and restaurants we wanted to go to. Kirsty's place is clean and cute and a great spot for a quiet weekend. She was great to communicate with and left thoughtful touches in the space-- like chocolate and local tips. Highly recommend it! We will stay here again in the future, for sure."
16998097,129971292,,18687921,Tim,"Full disclosure. I know Dennis from the neighborhood, but that's one of the reasons I trust his listing and am ok sending family to stay here. It is as good as advertised. Dennis puts a very detailed touch on making this a great private area in one of the premier locations and neighborhoods in all of Seattle. You are literally walking distance from the top of phinney ridge which is full of unique shops, restaurants, stores and pubs. You can shoot over to busier Ballard in minutes or walk over to greenlake. The location is superb. The space itself is great. Dennis did an outstanding job of making the space comfortable and private. I would gladly stay here again or have family or friends stay. He was an excellent communicator and took great care of me."
24715983,273043546,,186995576,Brianna,"Great place in a great location! If you want to be downtown in Seattle, this is a great place to stay. Catch the light rail and get to downtown! The house is very nice with newer updated changes! They have done a great job in thinking of what you might need! :)"
27111854,296878653,,18730103,Michael,"Booked Carly’s beautiful space for a last-minute trip and could not have been happier. Communication was fast and efficient and check-in was seamless. The unit itself was amazing and the location was perfect. Carly’s husband brought us coffee filters the first morning we were there and mentioned that they had just completed redoing the space, which did not come as a surprise. Everything was extremely well done, very stylish, and impeccably clean. Carly and her husband were also amazing hosts. We had the chance to talk to them a few times during our visit and they could not have been nicer. Overall it was an outstanding experience and I would be thrilled to stay with them again any time we are in Seattle."
7.03E+17,7.33E+17,,18759508,Stefanie,Such a wonderful home. We felt so welcome and comfortable. The couch is a very dreamy place to enjoy a coffee in the morning ??
24037284,264415524,,187750402,Alexey,This is the perfect place for a weekend getaway with the spouse. The upstairs bedroom was very comfortable and cozy. The view of the water was great from the double doors upstairs. Not to mention the short drive to downtown Seattle is awesome. <br/>Jessica is a great host as well. Quick responses and made us feel at home. My wife and I were looking for a weekend getaway from work and kids and Jessica made sure we had our privacy. Definitely a great place and great host to have.

26466765,289607065,,187920991,Dom,If you’re thinking about booking this place do it. One of the most beautiful homes I’ve ever had the privilege of staying in
21155590,205268125,,188035,Sani,"Allyson's place is a fantastic destination if you want the convenience of restaurants and downtown with a cozy quiet neighborhood feel. Be advised, this is a basement apartment, so the ceilings are low. But both my hubby and I are short and the low ceilings didn't detract at all from the great environment of the place. We LOVED the convenience to restaurants and the water taxi that gave us amazing access to Downtown Seattle. And Allyson even checked in with us multiple times throughout our stay to ensure we were taken care of and enjoying ourselves. I hope Allyson's place is open for our next trip to Seattle!"
21105396,272645859,,188185683,Kristie,This is a home with a view and plenty to do on days you don't want to go explore Seattle. The pool is a great time and there are plenty of books and board games for the whole family. Ian is a great host.
8104742,57096950,,18822190,Yuejia,"In all, my friends and I had a great time living here. This house is well-equipped and clean when I get in, with full set kitchen stuff and comfortable bedding. Also the location is not bad-about 15mins to downtown by bus. Ted is extremely nice and kid, answering lots of my questions with patience. I'd like to choose this place again if my friends come visit."
49497372,755413779,,18823485,Wendy,"Amazing Casita! The photos do not do it justice! Really comfortable, sparking clean and the hosts were amazing! Would highly recommend!

32817061,476660858,,188954788,Saqib,Mike is a great host. His place is located very centrally and in a very nice residential neighborhood. Anytime we had any questions Mike would respond right back and even came to visit us to make sure that we were completely happy.

34264537,448086002,,190358722,James,The host is amazingly responsive and the location is truly convenient! There’s a drug store that’s less than a minute’s was away that came in clutch. It’s close to the freeway and lots of really nice cafes and restaurants.
24755524,303173564,,190473024,Brett,"Signy was truly amazing to us, we were her first air bnb guests and before we got there the brand new place wasn't going to be ready for us in time by days due to permitting issues, but she stepped up huge and let us use her own place. She cared enough to let us stay there and it saved our trip, we went down to the place to meet with her me and my 3 friends and we looked at where we would of stayed and i say the value is great! the location is right by a bus stop but we chose to walk because the city is beautiful. They left us books of things to do in Seattle, she even recommended breakfast places to us for when we first arrived. I cannot describe how much it meant to us being able to use her place. We will be back to stay in the beautiful brand new place. These people truly care, best air bnb i have stayed at for sure!"
48739960,749500203,,190503856,Hunter,"This was the best Air BnB Stay we have ever had. Thank you for going above and beyond to make our stay special. We will definitely be staying with you again! Bill and Jimi are the ideal hosts. They took time out of their busy schedule, going above and beyond, to make sure we had the best time in Seattle as possible. The Bed was probably the nicest bed I have ever slept on, the space was much larger than it seemed through the photos. Most importantly it was the best location in all of Seattle. Walking distance to anywhere you would want to go. Thank you again from the bottom of our heart."
36111633,564879531,,190913900,Zula,Everyone at the hotel is friendly and value your stay. Definitely worth the money and stay!!!

25583974,299841111,,191936640,Bethany,"This place is excellent for families. We were so pleased. It was very clean and well equipped. The hosts left some great info about the city. The neighborhood was great and close to downtown, parks, dining , and the beach. They aren't kidding about the garage being small, but we found ample parking close by."
3908378,18218466,,19240588,Sam,"Drew was very easy going and welcoming. He had an amazing map of the area and fun places to go and check out. Bicycling around town was a great bonus! <br/>The bathroom and shower were also amazing! Comparable to 4/5 star hotel bathrooms. <br/>The washer and dryer were also very convenient and came in handy as we were wrapping up a 10 day trip throughout the Pacific Northwest.<br/><br/>"
25394602,281872114,,1924707,Abby,"Beautiful, modern and well styled! Perfect little studio for two to recharge while exploring Seattle. Great hospitality touches—Netflix’s, Coffee, snacks, parking and a wonderful bed. Loved this home!!"

This was definitely the best value of the available locations in Seattle.<br/>Would definitely recommend this place and stay again when in Seattle."
48315408,739721902,,193033610,Stefan,"Karen was so thoughtful, she checked on us everyday if we need any help during our visit. She waited for us late midnight to show how we can park and give useful information. The place is very convenient, right at the heart of Seattle. Free parking, clean host, nice communication. Thumbs up for my visit and I will be back for sure. Book here ??"
3559811,17031371,,19303707,Rahul,"Melissa was a wonderful host who replied within a very short period of time and made the apartment available. Later she discussed with me some things I was looking for in general. The apartment was exactly as promised: it was clean and nice, and I also got to use her parking space. There was a nice fan which helped as the day was quite hot during my visit. The neighborhood was extremely close to the university which is what I was looking for, but it also meant that it was somewhat crowded."
3766055,16879603,,19308605,Crystal,Beautiful home. Gorgeous room. Lovely and kind hostess. Would definitely stay again.
52555603,4.73E+17,,193316092,David,Sherry was a great host! She kept in constant communication with us. The property was amazing and had a great view! She ran into some cleaning delays with the property we originally booked but called us and offered us an upgrade to a bigger and better property for our troubles! It was greatly appreciated! We very much would recommend her and stay at one of her property’s the next time we are back in Seattle. Thank you Sherry for a great stay!
46674369,714955282,,193573543,Debbie,"Karen was an excellent host! She was very communicative and checked in on us daily. Despite the hiccups, she was there to make sure we enjoyed our stay. Very cute place in an great location as everything needed was within walking distance."
475361,1589681,,1937432,Lilia,"Marilyn and Cynthia were very warm and welcoming hosts. The very first morning Cynthia was so kind to invite us for breakfast to a German bakery, just to make us feel home. Their house is nicely located, directly at a creek surrounded by beautiful trees - perfect for a good sleep after a relaxing jacuzzi bath. It was also a pleasure to see their art and the place where they are creating it. I warmly recommend that place!"
24188484,254106931,,193822,Jenna,"Rina's place is clean and well organized. I liked the colorful decor in the living room. The living area is spacious with room for a sitting & relaxing space, kitchenette/dining area, and large built in desk for trip planning or getting work done. The location was great, only a 5 minute drive to my favorite restaurants in the University District."
25521162,281434823,,193901983,Chris,"This house was absolutely fantastic. It has a unique layout that doesn’t detract, and only adds character. When one of our group members accidentally locked us out of the house, Vince came and let us in at 2am and was a total gentleman the entire time, and was great to get to know along the way. He really went above and beyond to make sure everything was going well for us, and graciously provided our early morning “rescue!” Other hosts should strive to be more like Vince! I will without a doubt rent this property or another of his in the future!"
9098494,54060680,,19406236,Avrohom,"This house was great! Seemed like we were spending the weekend in a Dwell magazine spread. The neighborhood was a mix of residential and commercial being off California Ave. the main artery that bisects east / west of W. Sea. there are plenty of interesting neighborhood shops and eateries as well as post office and banks. The house had good views (from the upper floors ) of Pugent Sound and Alki beach is just a little over a mile away. The linens on the bed were inviting, the mattress in the master bedroom comfortable and plenty of towels available."
25809603,284637097,,194111047,Cameron,"Very clean and nicely decorated, central to downtown West Seattle."
23698647,276789785,,194179763,Aaron,"This place is based in a beautiful neighbourhood, has *multiple* decks, more than enough bedrooms/bathrooms and is well maintained by the owners."
35601606,499650488,,195000637,Emily,Amazing place. Charming old house with a definitely haunted basement haha ??. Super close to u district and downtown. Would definitely stay again :)
52264286,6.04E+17,,195107466,Christina,Listing wasn’t accurate. W&D are not in unit but for a fee in a basement that I didn’t know how to get to. Mini fridge only - no freezer- luckily I found out before check in & had to purchase a freezer as I was staying for a month & had already done food prep. Very dusty inside & carpet needed cleaning. I was told they only do a deep clean twice a year but could come back to spot clean if I wanted. Parking spot is necessary/ even though it was right next to the dumpster it would have been difficult to find on the street. Mattress cover was way too big so ended up pulling up sheets & being tangled in it. Just not what I was expecting. I stayed for a month & originally planned to stay for longer. Glad I didn’t book longer. Host also doesn’t want to message through Airbnb but defers to a property manager (who was responsive). Again not what I was expecting. A few days only and would be ok.
52323236,5.07E+17,,195200741,Samuel,"Don and Thuy’s fantastic home in the Roosevelt neighborhood of Seattle was a great find. We stayed for 9 days while looking for a permanent place and moving. It was so nice to come back to this comfortable place each night and unwind. <br/>The location is great. A Safeway market is one street away and the light link rail is .3 miles away. There are two designated parking spots behind the house if you prefer to drive around via automobile.<br/>The kitchen is well equipped, spacious and probably one of the best out of all the short term rentals I have stayed in. The owners loving remodel is apparent. <br/>The bedrooms were comfortable and spacious. The main bedroom on the first floor is wonderful. The entire basement offers 2 additional bedrooms, a kitchen, dining space and a tv viewing area. <br/>This is a perfect place for a family (or two)! There is plenty of space for everyone. So much space that we didn’t use the upstairs bedroom and bath. <br/>Very pleased with this awesome find!"
43461448,627867531,,19543791,Gina,"Always such a delight to be in this warm, comfy, beautiful views home. Can’t wait to book again. It truly is turning into home away from home. <br/>Thank you Starla <br/>Gina Aitchison"
10332360,61721279,,19546343,Carey,"Our stay at your bnb was terrific. So much more room than any hotel and far more convenient. From the excellent location, fresh decor, comfortable cozy linens to the great tasting coffee, we loved everything about it!! We will definitely be back! Thanks for all the personal touches!"

38645782,532937401,,195922242,Abigail,"This space was so cute and full of thoughtful touches. The space was very cozy and functional. You cannot beat the location. Restaurants, shops, stores, westlake center & the light rail-all within walking distance! Other places were a short Uber/Lyft ride away. Elliot was very responsive and is a great host!"
44229955,652435298,,19644293,Anna,The host is wonderful and the place was immaculate and well designed.
23700774,281898278,,196451629,Yvonne,"Great neighborhood, we took public transport and the bus stop was just at the end of the private road. One bus took us right to the space needle. <br/>The house was perfect for our party of five with plenty of space. Will stay there again in a heartbeat"
15339233,113271341,,19655068,Mol,"Phyllis was super helpful and easy going. She was willing to work with me regarding check-in and check-out times and very responsive. The house is new, modern, clean and nice. All the kitchen appliances are in great shape and we had everything we needed and wanted. A perfect home away from home."
28722561,334333835,,196698567,Itzel,Great place to stay!
50248085,3.85E+17,,196858709,Kate,"Serene and beautiful apartment! The photos do not do this place justice. Many high quality finishes and details, in an overall simple and pleasing design, make this an aesthetic treat. I would happily choose here again for short or long stays."
52170091,4.62E+17,,197051630,Elizabeth,"Wonderful time!!!! This place is beautiful, great location and loved all the decor inside!

12987793,79259201,,19705711,Saurabh,Rob is a great host. I was traveling with my wife and my parents-in-law. He gave us a really good tour of the house when we arrived. This beautiful house is in excellent location nearby to the restaurants and grocery stores. All the rooms were clean and tidy. Would love to stay here again.
7529124,48322572,,19716860,Michelle,"The stay was absolutely amazing. The place was clean and the bed comfortable. The loft has everything you need; its location is ideal, neighborhood is quiet, and parking is no issue. Jenifer and her husband were wonderful hosts, very attentive. Super accommodating by letting me check in early. Enjoyed my stay a lot."
45897946,716311828,,1971697,Letty,"We had such a great stay. The flat was very clean and well equipped. The kitchen had everything available to cook a nice meal if we stayed in. The beds and bedding were very comfortable and the bathrooms were nicely updated. <br/>The Flat is in a nice, safe neighborhood. We felt comfortable walking around with the kids and everyone enjoyed the views. It is also close to the Zoo and a great park."
1100686,13312933,,1971733,Caroline,"We loved our spacious tree-top room! And that's exactly what it is! We live just a mere four blocks away, renting out our house and taking a stay-cation. Going to Ann's place was like walking into a forest: tall trees, a street without right away so no cars, and a wonderful back yard. Our room and bathroom were great, and Ann herself is very interesting to talk to, attentive but not intrusive. We plan to go back!"
41381981,595787681,,197408244,Ryan,"I loved staying here for the weekend while I visiting a friend in Seattle.<br/>Lauren was incredibly helpful and responsive when I booked and throughout the stay if I had any questions.<br/>Check-in and check out were a breeze and I had no troubles even though I arrived fairly late in the day.<br/>The space itself was sparking clean, cozy, and comfortable. It was also in a great location - walking distance to Pike Place or down to the water. There are plenty of restaurants around as well.<br/>Definitely don't hesitate to book here!"
47858207,750838967,,197977872,Amrit,Sheila is an amazing & gracious host. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at her residence. Her welcome chocolate chip cookies are absolutely divine! We highly recommend you stay here when you come to Seattle!

6908161,38313722,,19841690,Leslie,"This was my first experience with Airbnb and it was perfect. Sasha was kind and very welcoming and accommodating. She is a great host. Her home was lovely, comfortable, and clean. The neighborhood was great! The home is in walking distance of shopping, restaurants, coffee shops, etc. I would recommend this Airbnb to anyone and I would stay here again."
38263630,543904024,,19861823,Shayan,Nice place to stay if you are traveling. Place is close to a lot of attractions and beaches as well.
34448530,454175071,,198751948,Amanda,This place was so comfortable. When we arrived they had fresh baked cookies waiting for us in our room. It was a quiet neighbourhood. Only a 10 minute drive to the downtown core; which was convenient.
28340406,321193101,,198911109,Cora,"Staying at Anthony’s place felt like a home away from home experience. Casual, laidback atmosphere, in a beautiful neighborhood which felt safe day or night. Close to shopping, food, and adventure."

3959460,18776071,,1994407,Zachary,"From the moment we arrived to the time we had to leave Beth and her home were a fantastic feature of our trip. She lives in a quiet, clean and unique neighborhood, and was a bright and pleasant host.<br/><br/>Beth went out of her way to be accommodating, providing us with eggs fresh from her chickens, and a welcoming letter with some fantastic suggestions for local events and features. She was sure to let us know that if there was anything we needed for our stay to ask if she had it. <br/><br/>The apartment was the upstairs portion of the house, affording views of the neighborhood and surrounding area. The upper porch was safe and comfortable, I spent the morning of our second day reading in the dawn light. The apartment itself was gorgeous and open, with many skylights allowing ample sunlight during the day and views of the stars at night. Not pictured is a wonderful nook setup for children to sleep and gaze out at the sky. I attempted to do so myself - but am simply too tall. :-D<br/><br/>The bedroom space houses a rather large comfortable bed. The pillows were featherdown, and of a quality that made me reconsider how I've spent my life sleeping with an inferior substitute. The comforter also appeared to be featherdown, and the sheets were fantastic. All of the bedding smelled freshly washed and felt wonderful.<br/><br/>Within walking distance of her home are many attractive locations for a variety of activities. Easy access to food ranging from 24/7 American Diner (best corned beef ever!), to Thai, Mexican, Greek, and many others.<br/><br/>One of our goals during the trip was to try some local coffee, and we found many small coffee shops in the surrounding area. Our favorite was Cafe Vita - offering what we felt was the best french pressed coffee around.<br/><br/>If Beth will have us back - we'd love to stay with her again on any future trips. Her home was simply the best we could have hoped for, with none of the distractions of a regular hotel, and provided us with the privacy and quiet we desired for our short vacation."
52143683,6.27E+17,,200055218,Gerardo,"This is a very good place to stay, you have everything you need. The location is great and I loved the fact that you have your own parking spot.<br/>The comunication was very clear. <br/>Thank you Helen. I recomend this place."

50664092,4.81E+17,,200538527,Trena,"This is a beautiful apartment and it is in a great location! I loved that on my days off I had many options for dining in walking distance and the neighborhood has a very nice atmosphere! The light rail was so convenient, I rarely drove my car downtown! And the host were so thoughtful! I loved all the little extras! If I come back to Seattle for work I would definitely love to stay here again!"
26841349,290583937,,200710511,Kiara,Perry was so nice and very hospitable! He made our stay comfortable!
27682114,309103331,,200875571,Jeff,"I highly recommend; very nice place to stay. Clean, quiet, nice kitchen, peaceful garden, my own designated parking. Fantastic location and neighborhood, short walk to restaurants/shops along Queen Anne Ave, safe and near everything that's Seattle. Will stay there again when I return. 5 Stars."
34983149,464459673,,200882459,Kaela,"This place is absolutely beautiful, and looks exactly like the photos. The bed was super soft & comfy too! If you’re looking to travel to the tourist destinations (space needle/pikes place) it’s less than 15 minutes away from practically everything. It’s also in a quiet neighborhood, tucked away from the noise of the city. Justin was a great host and super quick with communication. I would definitely stay here again if I’m ever back in the city."
20165246,302539859,,201190561,Keith,This is a good low budget place but not if you are particular about your amenities. Great for the younger folks.
27960420,321204003,,201279621,Jordon,"I had a fantastic stay in Davids perfectly located condo. I also appreciated all the great choices in tea! I was able to enjoy the rising sun from his balcony.

45996405,709760496,,2017025,Courtney,"This space is really stylish and cozy! All furnishings and appliances are new and the kitchen is amazing equipped for anything you'd need to cook. The large windows in the main living area allow for great lighting during the day. It was a cozy place to work from home and explore South Seattle. It's a nice location in Beacon Hill - you can walk to cafes and parks. The walking trails at Lake Washington and Seward Park are a few minutes drive away. There are many restaurant options for take out or delivery (especially during COVID). Luke, the host, was very responsive when I asked a few questions. I'd stay in this Airbnb again!"
49958960,4.11E+17,,201894870,Heather,Thomas offers a wonderfully renovated townhouse close to Pike Place Market and other sights and activities. I’d recommend to other families looking for space and value!
353110,1080517,,2019171,Allison & Jerry,"Simply a lovely place to stay. Quite, private, spacious room for both of us. We were thrilled to have fresh coffee beans, grinder and a french press for that first morning cup. Close (3 min drive) to Alki for that morning or evening walk/run along the beach. Only a couple of blocks from 3 markets, movie theater, restaurants, etc. and 5 minutes from the West Seattle junction for all your funky, fun shops. Looking forward to a return visit!"
39542562,8.57E+17,,202339595,Robert,The most organized and clean Airbnb I have ever been too. Eve was so thoughtful and responsive to all of our questions and needs. I could not recommend Eve's place enough!
8870139,56889068,,20242776,Steph,LOVE The Carriage House!!! I can't wait to return to Seattle and stay here again. The place has so much character and charm. We were warm and cozy with the fireplace and had yummy French Press in the morning. It was nice to have a place to park our car. The shower was amazing. The list can go on and on. I recommend The Carriage house for sure!
1356339,7404208,,2025358,Ashley,"Apartment was great! It was modern, clean, and in a great location! It was about a 20 minute walk right to pike place market in the heart of Seattle. Will definitely be staying here every time I go back to Seattle."
27705446,309747476,,202850417,Devin,an extremely cozy space located close to capital hill. daniel is a lovely host who is responsive and friendly. not to mention having us last minute when our other Airbnb fell thru. if we are ever back in the area we are DEFINITELY staying at Daniels again!
39949725,578449712,,202854394,Dominic,Great place to stay. Check-in process was easy and they were able to provide me with a room despite arriving early. Amenities and complimentary breakfast exceeded my expectations.
12191280,72462682,,20311689,Erika,Looked just like the pictures. Nice breakfast fixins and even flowers (!) left for us. Nice quality construction and great location. Linens for the couch made this a nice studio for our needs. Thank you!
8.17E+17,9.28E+17,,203364819,Amy,"Easy check in and check out. House is used solely as a rental, so doesn't have full cooking necessities or the homey feel of some Airbnbs, but is very clean and worked well as a place to stay while seeing friends in the area. Bed was very comfortable. No fan or A/C in the bedroom; I was fine opening the window in the evening, but something to keep in mind for the warmest months. Curtains are pretty thin, so I used my eyeshade at night. Light rail, restaurants, and park within walking distance."
26958405,295092710,,203619703,Ron,I highly recommend the Nesting Place at Roanoke Park. Laurie was more than willing to make our stay as comfortable and convenient as possible. Everything was very clean and well equipped. We loved everything about our stay including location and hope to book again soon!
6.06E+17,7.53E+17,,203623677,Austin,"Nice place, not great parking options"
5882923,29707703,,20380367,Sara,"In a last minute search, I feel extremely lucky to have found Terry!s brand new apartment available. It is a beautiful apartment with easy access to fun shops and good restaurants as well as downtown Seattle. The zoo and Green Lake also are close. Available parking is always a plus for me.<br/><br/>Terry was an outstanding host - he was friendly, accommodating and even left a chocolate Easter bunny to greet me at check-in!<br/><br/>I am almost reluctant to give this glowing review - I am certain that next time I need a last minute place, Terry's apartment won't be available!"
26845976,296886535,,204152795,Tracy,"We thought this space was fabulous with thoughtful touches making our stay incredibly comfortable. We have no suggestions for improvements, the hosts have clearly done their research and provided everything that was needed or wanted. As I said, very thoughtful and the space was gorgeous. We will stay here again."
23548888,242918563,,20418462,Ahmed,"Suzie was very communicative, great host! And the townhouse was very beautiful and spacious. Definitely my go-to while in Seattle."
670262,3496724,,2044151,Troy,"I had an absolutely painless experience staying with Elisa and Tom. The house is clean and the bedroom is well-appointed (radiant floor heating is amazing).<br/><br/>It's in a wonderful location that's at once quiet and a few blocks from the retail core on Greenwood, including a Fred Meyer grocery store and lots of restaurants. The buses to downtown are frequent and fast.<br/><br/>Elisa has thought through lots of small but helpful logistics, such as providing a kitchen shelf for my pantry items (without needing to ask). She genuinely cares and it shows.<br/><br/>I can't recommend staying with Elisa and Tom highly enough."
5918741,33157439,,20444599,Veronica,"We loved our stay in JK and Crys' place. Everything was just as described - they gave very detailed instructions on how to find the place and get in. The apartment was adorable and very clean! JK and Crys were also super accommodating with our late check in and check out, and available throughout the week for questions. The neighborhood is awesome, with lots of bars, restaurants, etc within footsteps. Definitely a great experience!"
10497998,61400225,,20448298,Jeff,"This place is better than advertised. Really well designed. Everything is new and nice. The heated floors were a bonus in the early morning, wifi was great, parking was a breeze, and some superb restaurants are just a few blocks away. This place is a slam dunk."
1696389,354119011,,204547940,Joshua,"You expect to get more than you bargained for at William's! great location, exquisite setup, clean rooms and amenities. And helpful hints and advice from host. Great value. we enjoyed our stay."
3861673,18603364,,20455262,Claire,"Debbie is a great host! She and her son greeted me and showed me to the separate room behind the house. Their place was easy to find and in a nice, quiet neighborhood. This detached room rental was a great option for me as I knew I would be returning late and did not want to disturb anyone. I could easily go around back at the end of the night with the handy flash light key chain that held the room key. <br/><br/>I could tell right away that Debbie put a lot of thought into the room making sure that her guests had everything they could possibly need. The bed and pillows were very comfortable providing the good night's sleep I needed for the next day. <br/><br/>Also, I was able to park right in front of the house on the street which is always a plus in Seattle.<br/><br/>I appreciate the time and thought Debbie put into this rental to make it a comfortable respite from your busy day in the city. I will certainly check with Debbie first the next time I need accommodations in Seattle."
19738365,355024864,,204627752,Lucca,"don't expect much of the room,super tiny but worth the price,and ask the location before you go the adress it's wrong ;) (spent 50 dollars from the airport to the wrong adres),but she stills a awsome host,and a whole good family too,she takes a ""feel days"" to reply but stills good,wouldn't recommend for a long term but if it's just for a weekend or something it's fine :)"
26425189,302490839,,205080651,Angel,"Mozelle was a very exceptional host, she went above and beyond with communication and the place was spotless! She also gave great recommendations on dinner which me and my girlfriend loved! She’s a super host in my opinion!"

7502246,40841994,,2059474,Jordan,"This cottage is cozy and adorable, and is perfectly located! It's a 5-10 minute walk to the main drag of Alki Beach, which is gorgeous and lively. Shauna provided some excellent nearby restaurant recommendations, like Duke's Chowder House. We also discovered a great vegan place, Chaco Canyon, a short 10 minute drive away. Downtown Seattle is a short hop by water taxi, and about 20-30 minutes by Uber/Lyft.<br/><br/>The place itself seems newly redone, and has plenty of space and privacy. We were very comfortable here!"
8106157,103292590,,20606630,Peggy,Benjamin provided us with good relevant information and was prompt in responding to our questions.
12991648,97253300,,20614641,David,"Kate's place is a cute, nice place. Before arrival, we got the welcome message. Upon arrival, we saw welcome gifts. During stay, we got our questions answered in a timely matter. We felt are in good hand in a new place. All our 3 couples enjoyed very much."
793629,3141774,,2062582,Gregory,"Our stay at this lovely house was fantastic! It is a very cozy, inviting spot, respresented very accurately by the photos and description. Candace, the proprieter, was very helpful throughout the entire process. Her instruction manual for check-in and check-out is very clearly written and thorough. Communication with Candace was a breeze, with prompt replies to all of our questions. The house is located in a very quiet residential area with easy access to main arteries leading to the downtown, Pike Place, and Capitol Hill areas.....approximately ten minutes away from each. In short, our visit was a real pleasure and we look forward to staying again sometime for a longer visit."
26279644,492987198,,206514748,Yoshimi,This AIRBNB was amazing! Not only did it have amazing amenities but the BEST hosts I have ever had in all of the Airbnb’s I have stayed in! Brendan and Jena were so kind and easy to get ahold of and ask questions! We will definitely love to stay with them again in the future!
25237275,298790732,,20659388,Victoria,"This house is so cozy and wonderful. Located in a clean, quiet neighborhood, we had quick access to everything we wanted to see. Shannon responded to my many questions so promptly, and she was a great hostess. I am very glad we chose to stay here, and will definitely recommend it to friends who travel to Seattle! Thank you Shannon!"
7.66E+17,7.93E+17,,206772333,Laura,"This was the perfect place for our family of 6. Plenty of bedrooms and bathrooms, in a walkable neighborhood near the places we wanted to go. Super clean and well set up. I would say that the kitchen is better set up for stovetop cooking (good knives, lots of pans) than for oven cooking (no sheet pans, casserole dishes, measuring cups, etc.) but that may change over time. The 4th bedroom is in the basement, which may be a plus or a minus depending on how much privacy is desired - it has its own heater so was warm enough but just felt a little bit separate. We were there in the winter so didn't get a chance to enjoy the porches but they look nice! We were able to fit a large SUV in the garage. The description notes that street parking is free but it does have 2 hour limit on weekdays, just something to be aware of. Some of the outside steps are a bit tilted - something to be aware of if someone in your party is less sure on their feet. Overall, highly recommended!"
27434633,314459753,,206807745,Rishi,Great price and great location. Bit cramped for 6 people.
46452459,711002701,,206810035,Justin,"Very nice and private. Clean and friendly, with everything you need for a welcoming place to stay."
17777744,146830518,,2070560,Joel,"We had a wonderful stay at Linda's place. The apartment is in a separate structure set back from Linda's house, so that there is a sense of privacy combined with the ready availability of the host (who is extremely friendly). The place was spotless and had everything we needed and more. For example, Linda had prepared a handy binder with information about getting around, local restaurants and grocery stores, etc. Not only do we recommend the place to others, but we would certainly want to stay there again ourselves on future visits to Seattle."
9531,857976,,207057,Wendy,"My husband, 2 year old daughter and I stayed at the Sweet Orange for several nights. It is a darling house, with everything one could need or want for a pleasant stay. The gas fireplace was very cozy, and the beds were so comfortable it was difficult to leave them. <br/><br/>I would happily recommend this place for short or long term stays."
3379116,19555163,,20739379,Mary,"This was our first stay using airbnb, we were so pleased with the carriage house and the overall experience. Jill, our host, replied promptly made us feel at home. We hade 4 adults, 2 teenagers and two toddlers staying in the carriage house. It fit our needs and had something for everyone. The kitchen was perfect, the games and books were fun for all and the wifi was great. It was clean and the towels and linens were very nice. The attention to detail was appreciated. I hope we can return and stay again."
34891924,460266633,,208468755,Moninder,Great hosts with super quick response to any questions. They were very accommodating with few of our requests and the guest section had complete privacy. the place was clean with all amenities. Highly Recommended !!

14855437,103666660,,21019880,Justin,"I don't think I'd change one thing - this place was perfect! I had my own private bathroom and bedroom and patio access. There was plenty of space for my bags and a large desk to work at. Kangie was amazing and friendly - she we so helpful with recommendations for cool places to eat and visit! And she was always friendly when our paths crossed and respectful of space - when I just got in after a long day, I didn't worry about running into her, she totally understood that I wasn't talkative etc. And the location was amazing - I was able to walk to Ballard and Freemont and there is an amazing (even for Seattle, amazing) coffee place just half a block away for a morning snack & espresso.<br/>I would love to stay at her place again - I really can't think of anything I'd change! Stay here - you won't regret it!"
40400915,581030960,,210297456,Raymond,Diane’s place is stylishly appointed and gives a nice cozy place to come back to after a day up in mountains. Superb communications makes checking in/out a breeze ??

7285916,83324419,,21061083,Linda,"A cruise to Alaska led my husband and I to a two-night, pre-cruise stay in Seattle. We considered several options from imposing on friends, booking a room in a hotel or choosing Airbnb. As it turned out, choosing Airbnb -- specifically, Jenn and Louis's lovely apartment -- was the best decision we could have ever made! <br/>When we arrived at 11 pm from our cross-country flight, the couple warmly greeted us and showed us around the well-appointed apartment; I make note of this because they could have easily left a key under the mat and left us to our own devices to figure things out. Their immediate hospitality coupled with a chilled bottle of champagne and glasses let us know that we were in for something special and, indeed, set the tenor for the remainder of our stay. <br/>Jenn and Louis thought of everything -- from the beautiful matelasse comforter that draped both the sofa and bed -- which would come in handy for Seattle's chilly evenings (there is a fireplace there, too) plush towels and linens -- to morning pastries and coffee, which Jen kindly delivered to us. Having stayed in many fine hotels, the all pale in comparison to what we experienced at Jenn and Louis's. We felt both pampered and at home at the same time!<br/>The location couldn't be beat: we were a couple blocks from beautiful Lake Washington, which offered numerous opportunities for leisurely strolls. But we didn't have to go far to enjoy beauty; the couple's garden is beautifully tended to, and we found ourselves just sitting outside enjoying coffee at the bistro table and enjoying the garden outside our door. <br/>Our stay was better than we could have imagined. We are thrilled to have been Jen and Louis's first guests at their Airbnb. For guests who follow us, you are in for a treat!"
38130428,522208554,,210621072,Genesis,"Amazing stay with Daisy. Her home is brand-new and very clean. Kitchen facilities were modern, bathrooms were sparkling, check-in is done on your using the keypad (so we were able to check in almost at midnight without any issues). Daisy is a friendly and accommodating host."

27993068,344491899,,210828972,Jennifer,Such an awesome place. It is huge with lots of space. The colors are awesome and the big screen TV was a hit with the kiddo when he found out it played youtube videos!
36237869,603905474,,210832542,Cameron,"Room was spotless, WiFi was fast, lots to do within walking distance, check-in was fast, couldn't ask for more."
28590842,327942708,,210834487,Gopal,Apartment is in excellent location. Very spacious. Comfortable.<br/>However furnishings are old and very threadbare. Bathrooms are tiny and not very clean. Bedrooms are dusty. Bring your own towels.
27895001,316658129,,211044051,Vincent,It a great place to stay something simple but shared with two other ppl who were staying there very quiet
27233427,319947306,,211052311,Chaehong,It was great private home. I enjoyed the private backyard and the location was quiet and safe. There is a minipark with a great playground just across the street so It was good for my little boy traveled with me. Thank you so much for the very clean accommodation.
41666500,603776739,,21109964,Dan,"This place is a small efficient, totally equipped apartment style living that feels brand new and totally separate from the main house. Couldn’t more highly recommend. If there’s something you’d think you’d need — they are ahead of you and you’ll find it neatly tucked in one of the immaculate and efficient corners. An ideal location and elegant simplicity."
36638018,503289257,,211229189,Hunter,"Wesley’s place is a must stay in the Seattle area.<br/>For one, it is very clean. Things were well kept and organized. The hosts provided a notebook with all the essentials that one needed to know during the stay. <br/>Secondly, Wesley and Daphne were very professional and down to earth in their approach. They are kind and thoughtful people who provided just about everything you might forget from home (yes, even the Q-Tips!). There were even basic essentials provided to prepare a nice meal.<br/>The hosts went above and beyond to provide a great experience. They provided great recommendations of where to eat, dine, and explore. They were easy to communicate with. And while this place is below their personal home, it is hard to tell that someone lives above you. A barking dog is hardly noticeable, and you could never really hear any chatter or loud noises from up above. It was never an issue for myself.<br/>The location was superb. My companion and I were able to partake in many expenditures around West Seattle alone. And when we went downtown, we relied on public transit, and were there before we knew it! It was fairly easy to get around!<br/>The last thing I’ll mention is the price. The value was definitely there. Super affordable for everything you get. In terms of other places and levels of quality around the Seattle area, this one had the best value for location and accommodation. I initially tried getting something downtown. I looked all over the city and could never find a better deal that made sense. I was hesitant at first about booking in the west side of town, but again, found that there was plenty to do there and that public transit was pretty simple to use. <br/>This place is a great stay if you are planning to explore the Seattle area! I highly recommend it, and I will certainly be back when I revisit Seattle in the future!!!"
4653552,25549486,,2113481,Lyndee,"Lela's space was just what my family needed. We live in Seattle and are doing some work on our house. We needed a place for a couple of weeks, and Lela's duplex was so much better than a hotel room. <br/><br/>We have three kids and a dog and didn't feel crowded. We did bring in an air mattress so our 8 and 10 year old boys didn't have to share the bottom double bunk, but it would work for two smaller kids. The kitchen was great, the essentials were provided. The beds and furniture were all very comfortable. <br/><br/>Being so close to Green Lake and Tangletown was awesome. It was fun to walk our dog and explore the neighborhood. It would be even better in the summer! <br/><br/>Lela was friendly and kind and checked in to make sure everything was OK. <br/><br/><br/>"
32645076,469484920,,21137366,Alanna,"Simon was a great host- he was very communicative and helpful when I got to the studio. The area is beautiful, it's right next to an arboretum that you can run/walk through and down the street was a little market for anything you needed. The studio is perfect for one or two people, plenty of sitting room and a nice little kitchen to cook in. I only stayed there for one night, but I would definitely stay again. Thanks, Simon!"
28106693,329364188,,211522256,Ashile,"Have you ever met someone and just KNOWN they were a good person? Well, thats Raj for ya.. A truly stand up kinda guy. He's so welcoming, staying at his home was like staying with a long time family friend. <br/>Every room as a view with Impeccable style throughout the entire condo. 7 Surround sound speakers, the most gorgeous kitchen! wow! wait till you see the countertops. This condo has argumentatively THE BEST VIEWS of: downtown + the water + ferris wheel + the sunset. I will without a doubt, be staying here again next time i'm in town."
26139729,729970091,,211766467,Brittany,"Must’ve caught the host on a really bad night, but asked a simple question and got an insanely rude, sarcastic answer. He apologized, but the damage was done. <br/>We were pretty uncomfortable the rest of the stay, and many of the appliances had issues. Didn’t feel comfortable reaching back out. Will not be returning."
19894816,173667069,,21176908,Hadar,A great spacious studio in the heart of Fremont neighborhood.<br/>Great hosts.<br/>Easy walk to Fremont's restaurants and bars.<br/>Very easy check in and check out process. <br/>I will definitely be back when I am back in Seattle.
19115007,159111107,,21176912,Ursula,"We met Christine and Kevin so that we could pick up the key. They were lovely and showed us around the place. It's a lovely, quiet neighborhood near some great restaurants. The basement is quite cold (great for the summer weather), so bring some slippers and a sweatshirt!"

43045062,627381399,,211899237,Yang,Amazing condo with great view of downtown Seattle. Also directly above a 3 story retail Target for a variety of stuff
32619057,514728543,,212467698,Jeffrey,"Reese’s condo was a great stay. To start off with, the location was amazing, being just a 5 minute walk from the space needle and museums, and the monorail which takes you to the pike marketplace for only $2.50 a person. It’s also a great neighborhood, with many eating options and retail stores within walking distance. <br/>The loft itself was also really good. The bed was extremely comfortable and all the amenities needed for a comfortable stay were provided. <br/>Would definitely recommend for anyone looking to stay in the downtown Seattle area."
36109379,751562934,,212741597,Lener,"Had a wonderful stay, fantastic staff, definitely would stay again."
50034681,765170488,,212982724,Kristina,This apartment is perfect for any group wanting to see as much of Seattle as possible! It is perfectly located right in the middle of everything and driving really isn’t necessary. Elizabeth and Jordan were great hosts and were very responsive and accommodating. Great stay!

28466540,327916631,,21303739,Paulette,"Great place. Clean, lots of amenities. Towels and bed pillows were nice and fluffy! Just wish it had come with parking which I could have requested in advance. But in Seattle, you don't need a car to get around. Lyft and Uber would have been great had we not had a car."
49406615,765008770,,213630993,Melissa,We loved staying at Susan's for a weekend getaway! The yard was spacious and everything we needed was in the house.
26472719,285066544,,21366452,Grace,"This place is beautiful, the pictures don't do it justice! Everything inside was super clean - important to a family with little kids. The king bed we slept in was extremely comfortable. My husband was happy that we had cable TV to watch soccer :) It was a beautiful day during our stay & we all walked to Green Lake together. We will definitely be coming back - thanks!"
392140,1235242,,2140101,Simon,"If a super friendly, and laid back west coast atmosphere is what you're looking for, and for a good price, Leslie's tin house is the place to be! Leslie even offered to pick myself and my girlfriend up from the Seattle harbor, a very kind gesture! The great view and Leslie's eclectic decor, are also great :)"
9.39E+17,9.84E+17,,21403755,Stacy,"Brenda's place was a steal - this Airbnb had high-end everything, and amenities I don't normally expect to see. Any time I needed something (aluminum foil, cooking spices), it was there. This space is especially good for a long-term stay given how well-equipped the kitchen was. For a basement space, it also had a lot more light than I was expecting. With the alley entrance, it's hard to even know the owners live on site. Close to both the Alki water taxi and Alaska Junction for transit to downtown. Beautiful, quiet neighborhood, and nice to have a private parking space. Terrifically fast wifi (534 Mbps up/245 down). Almost zero overhead noise from upstairs. The fan was great, and while the air conditioning might be appreciated during the rare Seattle heat waves, as a basement apartment it was always nice and cool. The space looks like it was put together by a professional interior designer. A bargain for the price."
4137114,21063189,,21444117,Dj,"The apartment was super centrally located to walk up and down Pike and access shopping, restaurants, and bars! I booked super last minute in evening and hosts were super accommodating and on it. The apartment was very clean and comfortable. The building is slightly older than I expected but the apartment is very comfortable. Only issue here was parking as I had a car and there is no reserved parking for the unit so I would have to do some juggling to have my car parked somewhere a few blocks nearby jn a parade which can cost 25-35 extra a day/night or free on the street at night which was fine for a few days and they were very clear and open about in advance which helped me plan how to deal with the parking as guess lots of places downtown don't have parking with the rental units.I would definitely recommend and stay here again. Great hosts and very welcoming! Appreciate the great communication with them."
47033205,727351372,,214475765,Lewisha,Quiet and cozy. Hosts were wonderful. We’ll book this room anytime we’re in the area
689309,3317399,,214728,Louise,"Philippe and his family were friendly and welcoming hosts, always concerned about our comfort. They were flexible in times for our arrival, and made sure we knew our way around the apartment and the neighborhood. The accommodations, including the king-size bed and private entrance were more than comfortable! Having a separate tv / coffee room at the entrance, including a futon, was a bonus. We certainly never felt crowded. The decor and amenities felt luxurious.<br/> We were there visiting our grandchildren and stayed in the apartment little time. However, after one of us had to leave Seattle early because of a family emergency Philippe and Siham even brought crepes for a special breakfast to console the one left behind.<br/> Our only caveat for long-term guests is that you should be aware the quarters were limited in space and equipment for cooking and eating meals. There was only a coffee maker and a nice toaster oven, as well as a small refrigerator. This was a new rental when we visited, so the hosts may change that in the future.<br/> Overall, we can't say enough nice things about the apartment and our hosts. We hope to go back soon and won't hesitate to stay there again.<br/>"
44812880,656457966,,21503472,Marissa,Extremely lovely apartment and centrally located in Downtown Seattle. Shayan was responsive and helpful as a host. Definitely book your stay here!
29396603,347091238,,21512628,Vera,"Wendy's place is fabulous! It is like a little suite with a living room and a desk we had all to ourselves. Also, I really appreciated the coffee machine in the morning! The neighborhood is lovely with little shops close by and the bus line down to downtown (takes 10 min). <br/>Wendy was a great host, giving us directions and provided late night check in! <br/>100% recommended!"
53296264,5.46E+17,,215267963,Miranda,Great large space for a great price. I loved the hot tub!
6245498,32614676,,21532853,Binh,"Kevin and Pepe were great hosts. They were very communicative and open to when we had an extra unexpected person. The house is really cute, my mom even wanted to steal the design of the desk in the spare bedroom. It's really close to everything and it was very easy to find parking. Would definitely book this again when I go back up to Seattle."
48382242,736787217,,215409003,Kelvin,"“They weren’t kidding when it says Pike Place is right out your front door! As soon as you walk out the apartment you’re in walking distance to pretty much everything Seattle has to offer. As someone who travels often I have to also show appreciation for all the little details Mikayla puts into your stay, including all the little amenities around the apartment: stocked water in the fridge, phone chargers, and most of all she’s quick to communicate for any of your needs. Thank you again for an awesome stay, would 100% recommend to anyone wanting to get the total Seattle experience."
28051995,325432535,,215437533,Matt,"The apartment was beautiful and homey. Charly and Linnea's hospitality made our experience so wonderful, they even gave us herbs from their garden to cook with.

32993666,427078706,,21651735,Michael,"The space was fantastic! In the heart of the city close to everything. The place is EXACTLY as the pictures show, clean, safe, great view, no better place to stay in Seattle if there for work or vacation. The flexibility in meeting up at check-in or check-out was perfect. I have had many great experiences at Airbnbs but this probably was my best stay at an Airbnb to date. Definitely will try to stay there again."
4400811,24765616,,21728802,Sebastian,"This is my second experience staying with Liam, and needless to say, it was just as fantastic as the first time. This time, I had a party of 6, and I rented out the whole house. Liam was again, just as informative and hospitable as before. I would gladly use Liam exclusively for any future events if I need a place to stay in Seattle. 10/10 would definitely recommend!"
14010358,124798393,,21728942,Zoë,"My husband, pup & I had a truly lovely stay in hummingbird hideaway. Nicole was easy to be in touch with if we needed anything but there was never an issue. I loved the layout of the space and how the every thing was decorated so nicely. We appreciated the extra comfortable bed & cozy sheets. They were also so kind to leave treats & a blanket for our pup and bottle of champagne for us on NYE. Thank you again!!"
29798397,359428131,,21805857,Alanna,"Heather’s place was what you imagine a perfect Airbnb experience to be like.<br/>The place was very charming and well described. Heather provided lots of little extras too (boutique, bedside chocolate coffee chunks?!).<br/>Communication was totally smooth. We actually had to change things up with our check-in time as we coordinated getting a seat at nearby restaurant Junebaby. Heather was casual and accommodating about it all.<br/> <br/>If you’re looking for an excellent room in a charming Seattle neighborhood, this is the one you want. We’ll definitely be back!"
22613740,335279907,,218072591,Melissa,"Great accommodations and location! Very clean and stylish space. Walking distance to walking/biking trails, neighborhood restaurants and sites, and a quick bus or car ride to downtown. No trouble with street parking. We appreciated all of the personal local recommendations and wish we had time to try more!"
47422675,724210146,,21820278,Leo,"I would love to keep this place a secret, but things this amazing need to be shared with the world. this place is absolutely perfect. every detail has been thought of. location, amenities, comfort, and thoughtfulness has been absolutely amazing. you will not find a better host on AirBnB than Jill. the only thing i would change is that i wish i could stay longer. this place will always be my first choice when i'm visiting Seattle"

5362889,28290224,,2190612,Ryan,"Thanks so much Drew! GREAT location for anyone staying wanting to stay downtown or close to the Arena. Easy access to great food and bars. Walking distance to the space needle. Host made us feel so welcome with some great recommendations. Place was spotless- looked like it had just been professionally cleaned. His place does have an available parking spot, but the garage is pretty tight. If you have to rent a car, make sure it's a small one. My first experience in Seattle was a great one- can't wait to come back!"
44705809,653960579,,21944973,Brooke,Cute private tiny house in hosts backyard!! Easy access to downtown Seattle and Nidhi was very easy to communicate with! Would come back again :)
6.36E+17,6.76E+17,,219942173,Michelle,"We were at home at Tayla’s clean and well designed 2 bedroom townhouse. Neighborhood is quiet yet full of restaurants, bars, and amenities including a Fred Meyer’s a short walk away. Home is on multiple bus lines so quick and easy to get to light rail, Northgate shopping and UW. <br/>Communications with Tayla from arrival all the way to check-out we’re outstanding. She is awesome at anticipating guests’ needs."
26279366,294199885,,22013241,Lauren,We had a great time at James place! Danae was super helpful with local restaurant recommendations and made sure we had everything we needed!

So convenient to both i5 and surrounding neighbourhoods of Greenwood/Ballard etc.<br/>We loved it and would definitely stay again! Thanks so much for having us!"
3992155,21108305,,22103153,Antonio,"Awesome cozy place in an excellent location. The space needle is less than 10 minutes away walking. Right around the corner from great bars, restaurants, coffee houses and markets. The roof deck is real spacious and with an unbelievable view of the space needle.

29372096,347048057,,221732617,Cameron,"This place is amazing! A beautiful, hip loft that makes use of all the space and feels much larger than i had anticipated. The whole place was absolutely spotless. The bed is super comfortable and the shower is out of this world. We had an excellent stay and Sean & Caroline were extremely helpful & accommodating! They always responded quickly. Exceeded our expectations, Would highly recommend!"
6.05E+17,7.82E+17,,221736583,Aiyshwariya,"The positives:<br/>- Close to Seattle center as well as QFC<br/>- Easy checkin<br/>- Timely responses<br/>- Furnished + necessary amenities<br/>The negatives:<br/>- This is a studio & NOT a 1 bedroom (I wish the description reflected this information as this makes a world of difference when there is no room separated with a door). This should not show up when filtering for 1 bedroom.<br/>- No parking<br/>- Although there is a work from home setup in this studio, there is a child day care right outside which is quite noisy. Wood flooring, which also means you can hear when upstairs neighbors do anything."

17790593,142954595,,22224034,Tobias,"I had a perfect stay at Bill and Michael's! Everything was as described or better and the location is great to explore Capitol Hill from. Very comfortable bed, everything was brand new and fresh. I was actually their first guest! I was also the only guest this weekend as they appear to be putting the finishing touches on the other rooms. The hosts had just the right amount of communication and were more than happy to give some advice on the area. It can feel a bit dicey to go with properties with no reviews but in this case it worked out great!"
17095283,138816094,,22273804,Denise,"Jacki is a great host! She responds quickly to questions and is very accommodating and caring. <br/>The studio is just a short walk from bus routes to downtown and close to the main Ballard area, including a really great farmers market, cinema, coffee shops and restaurants. And you still get the bonus of having a nice quiet area to come home to.<br/>The studio itself has a very comfy bed and an amazing 2 person shower! Everything in the studio brand new and very clean. Having a private washer/dryer in the unit is a great perk. I've been staying here for 6 weeks and am actually just moving to the twin studio apartment that's upstairs because there was another booking for this studio :) <br/>I would definitely recommend Jacki's place!"

We also loved that there was a good coffee place two doors away. <br/>Would definitely stay here again when in town visiting family."
34311900,481424239,,223701447,Vladimir,"Great location and very good room for its incredible price. Perry was very responsive and helpful whenever I needed something. Great place, I would totally go again if coming back to Seattle!"
16334559,303603245,,22381362,Lauren,"Micheal's home was just gorgeous. The photos share only a glimpse of how magical this space is in person. The kitchen had everything needed, the towels were super soft, the furniture was lovely, and even the bathroom was beautiful! Micheal and Thao were so helpful and responsive via email from check-in til check-out. I highly recommend staying here."
10835493,74972835,,22406331,Elysa,"Mariann was a wonderful host; she provided us with everything we needed, was reachable if there was a problem but also let us have our privacy! Definitely a great option in a quite neighborhood!"

32064854,413641580,,224114755,Carole,l'appartement est parfaitement propre et bien situé. Yulia est particulièrement attentive au bien-être de ses hôtes et très réactive.
14186845,96213216,,22417453,Ken,"We really enjoyed our stay at James’s guest house - once we were settled in, we didn’t want to leave! James is a great, communicative host. We were able to arrive at our convenience thanks to the electronic lock and accurate check-in instructions. The kitchen and bath – efficiently organized, both with full-sized furnishings – feel surprisingly spacious (even for tall folks!), and the living area/bedroom is peaceful and a great place to rest thanks to the quiet neighborhood. The new queen bed is remarkably comfortable. The neighborhood itself is a great place to stay: the famous Macrina Bakery is within smelling distance, a market with local produce is across the street from the bakery, and Kerry Park, which offers a fantastic view of the Seattle sunset, is only a 15-minute walk down the street. We traveled downtown and to Fremont using Lyft; anywhere we wanted to go was a short fun ride away. If you want to feel like you’re actually living in Seattle, James’s guest house is the place for you!"
6.84E+17,7.95E+17,,224456716,Kang,"The location of this house is very good, it is easy to get to every place I want to go, and the sound insulation is very good, so I can get a high-quality sleep."
4270642,21494235,,22452497,Michael,"I stayed in this studio for 3 nights. The description is accurate. It is really close to UW's campus, and there are a lot of food options around. It is also easy to go to downtown Seattle, as there are many bus stops nearby. To/From the airport it takes about an hour.<br/><br/>Here are the things I liked about it:<br/>- good water pressure<br/>- instant hot water in the shower/sink<br/>- clean when I arrived<br/>- location (campus, food places)<br/>- fast WiFi<br/>- good instructions and communication from/with the host<br/>- host checked in with me before I left<br/><br/>The only negative things:<br/>- noise travels very well in the building (although most of the time it was quiet)<br/>- as it is mentioned in the description, there is a shared door with the adjacent studio: there is a large gap in between the door and the floor, so you'll hear conversations/music... anything that is going on, so also be aware of your own private conversations etc.<br/>- I found the mat in the bathroom not very inviting, use a towel instead<br/><br/>All in all I had a good impression of the place. Melissa is very responsive and communicating with her is very easy. This combination of location, quality of the place and price is hard to find!"

21594030,220306245,,2253669,Rama,"Gorgeous loft, great location. Kianoush was very accommodating when my checkin got delayed and when I would contact her for additional amenities. It was a new listing and was lovely. Beautiful loft, comfy bed. Great heating. The building is a bit noisy, so I recommend earplugs if you are a light sleeper. Would definitely stay again."
7500191,40051405,,22539797,Christopher,Room was nice. Very well kept. Landlord was one of the nicest Ive dealt with since using AirBnB a year ago. Only complaint was the freezer was busted so no ice but Im sure he will have that fixed soon.
421168,1640930,,2259045,Anne,"We were looking for a place that was clean and quiet. The Wallingford Studio was exactly that, plus very private. Great location, very walkable.

6087451,31154433,,22593549,Clayton,"Reid and Aaleen were great hosts! Upon arrival, they took the time to show me around the studio, answered any of my questions and made me feel welcome. The instructions on how to operate the TV were nice to have. I had arrived pretty late on my check-in day and so I really appreciated that they had some snacks waiting for me in the kitchen. There is a great selection of restaurants down the street, well within walking distance. The studio is located in the perfect area. If you find yourself wanting to explore beyond the Fremont area, downtown is a quick 10min Uber ride away. There is is a bus stop about 200 yards from the property as well if you prefer public trans. Could't have been happier with my stay and look forward to the next time I visit Reid and Aaleen."
29488633,352111242,,226092728,Jeanie,"Location, location, location. Right on the Pugent Sound with great views, the beach, the action, and not forgetting some of the best food!"
42043837,624449308,,22623683,Ty,"What a great place to stay! Excellent location, easily accessed off I-5, two blocks from Ravenna park and a very short walk to the U District with bars, restaurants and shopping. Cute, clean, and comfortable private room in an excellent neighborhood. Best of all, Marla is an awesome host and makes you feel perfectly welcome in Seattle. I had a great stay!"
37946796,523527007,,226680348,Cody,"Nice comfy flat. Super convenient location for many sites on the waterfront. Within walking distance to the convention center, it is uphill, but was not a long walk at all. The location is just perfect for anyone wanting to experience downtown!<br/>No a/c so keeping the windows open helps really cool off the space. It was pretty comfortable. The only downside is that it is a high traffic area so it can be noisy with the windows open. Was not a bother to me, but may be for others. <br/>Overall it was an amazing stay. I look forward to being able to stay here again!"
1900698,9063578,,2269636,Pavel,"I enjoyed staying in Julia's home. The room is comfortable and clean. The location is very convenient and number of good restaurants and cafeterias are around. Julie is very positive and energized person. I am strongly recommend this place for staying in Seattle weather if you are traveling alone or with somebody else.<br/>Good luck!"

30130482,358523382,,227042676,David,"I travel to Seattle regularly for work and decided to rent a room instead of staying at a hotel. This place is in a quiet and quaint neighborhood close to downtown, and the room was furnished with high-end amenities and super clean. Melody is a great host and very helpful. I totally recommend it. I will definitely stay here again!"

50992310,4.22E+17,,22754041,Ben,"We checked in last minute, when our hotel had issues. Sherry's communication was awesome. The house is set up very well for a group of friends or a family with older children. The neighborhood is lively and walkable- though parking is a big challenge unless you have a very small car. Enjoyed our stay very much and would recommend this home and host to others."
39994345,586379446,,22756153,Kristy,Loved our stay!! Mauricio went above and beyond!!! I highly recommend!!! When we come back to Seattle we will absolutely stay again.
19589907,5.99E+17,,227664540,Emily,"This gorgeous townhouse is in a great, quiet neighborhood, within walking distance of great coffee at Resistencia Coffee and plenty of restaurants. Throughout our stay, trips into downtown Seattle took only 15-20 minutes via car (rideshare or rental, we did both). Be prepared for some stairs - it is a townhouse - but the space, neighborhood, and price were totally worth it! Sonia was super communicative and well-deserving of their super host title."
39561422,666448574,,227727679,Jermaine,Lola place offers an amazing feel just outside the city south on Beacon Hill.

3543247,22004232,,22866972,Susan,"What an absolutely wonderful experience! My husband and I had a great stay in Jeff's space. He welcomed us with several thoughtful treats, fresh eggs from the host's chickens, and the most gorgeous modern space we could have asked for. Jeff was great at providing detailed instructions for the amenities in the house and at giving recommendations for restaurants and bars, but he also gave us plenty of space and privacy. The house and the amenities are just awesome - there are clean, comfortable living and dining spaces with a fully appointed kitchen, a cozy loft for sleeping, and an outdoor hot tub and sauna. The surrounding area has lots of cute houses and a great neighborhood feel with a grocery store, drug store, and spots to eat within walking distance. We headed out by car and explored the city, which was easy to do from the home's location. We didn't want to leave! We'd definitely book Jeff's place again."
39948923,566446117,,228745,Sunny,"Nice room, but plan on shared bathroom and shower. No tv and no elevators. But room was immaculate."
30161231,364456925,,228807198,Jamie,We would definitely stay at this little cottage again! The beds were comfortable and the kitchen big enough to move around in. The two parking spots were a plus!
27633718,316187565,,22887470,Greg,Clean and comfortable studio on the ground floor. Perfect location and smooth communication with host
20327028,186512860,,2291161,Sean,"Jenny's little house is in a perfect location if you're a park lover - it's literally 200 steps from Lincoln Park. I ran every morning along the water in the park. The place is tiny, no doubt, but Jenny has carefully thought out everything, from the lighting down to matching soaps. The loft bed was very comfortable, and super sturdy too. I was there four days, and it was all I needed."
17889129,141348256,,22927381,Sandra,"We were very comfortable at Melissa's place. Great value for 2 bedrooms. I along with two other folks took a trip to Seattle and having the extra bedroom was a great convenience. Beds were big and bedrooms were very spacious along with a large living room space, equipped kitchen and table large enough for 3 or 4 people. The apartment is basic, simple yet very comfortable. It is in a great location with parking at a fair price. Melissa was quick to respond to messages the day of the trip and after we left as well."
48232413,769352023,,229600621,Andrew,"Angielena's place is a super fun and eclectic space. Angelina is a great host. The road facing rooms can be a bit noisy as the historic windows obviously weren't built with the same noise proofing as today. Angielena does offer earplugs however. Overall, fun experience and good value in Seattle's art district."
52639007,4.95E+17,,22980887,Scott,"Great location. Wonderful view of the space Needle, super comfortable bed, clean and easy. Brandon was very prompt with his communication. We will definitely return."

30772471,362137320,,230584686,Horaciio,"Beautiful home, very cozy and clean. A+ for cleanliness. Very spacious, would definitely reccomend this home. We spent christmas eve at this home and we were pleasantly surprised how sweet the owner was by putting up a christmas tree. We were three families total and not once did we feel crowded, overall a very spacious home."
2693700,13799587,,2307730,Jo,"This is simply the best AirBnB, exactly why I love this site. Spotlessly clean, bright and colorful, surrounded by flowers and a fantastic view of the sunset from the porch, private entrance, full modern kitchen with everything you need, huge bathroom, I cannot recommend a stay here enough. <br/><br/>The LOCATION alone! There are no hotels in Fremont, and it is the absolute best place to stay in Seattle. Right next to the canal and the Burke-Gilman trail, you can bike very conveniently or just walk to the tons of shops, coffee houses, bars, restaurants, and general artistic quirky charm that makes Fremont so great. Parking on the street was no trouble, even on the weekend, and we found the Oasis to be central and perfect for exploring downtown, Ballard, North and West Seattle.<br/><br/>Manuela has shared her home and seriously underpriced it's value, so I can only hope the people who are lucky enough to book here are fully respectful and appreciative, so they don't ruin it for everyone. She's a warm and responsive host, available but gave us complete privacy during our stay (we never saw the family at all, a son and husband, thank you to you both as well for sharing your beautiful home!), so we felt like we had a very safe and very private home during our vacation, which is priceless, and made the trip really great and worry-free. <br/><br/>This is the ideal of an AirBnb, don't miss out if you're staying in Seattle!<br/><br/>"
9.48E+17,9.59E+17,,23112720,Joe,All in all a very nice stay. Anna’s very responsive Apartment is beautiful. Delightful young couple

I spent a month basing out of her home and hiking around the northwest with friends. It was always a wonderful feeling coming home to her lovely clean space."
26232189,287982932,,23261588,Veronica,"Perfect little place, very comfy and a short ride to downtown, we also found some good restaurants nearby along with some Lincoln park which had some great trails down to the beach"

Love that there is easy access to the property as well as driveway parking. The neighborhood is very nice. The fridge and microwave was very useful for storing and heating up take home food. The portable heater was great for extra warmth needed. The hosts Tom and Alison were great! They greeted us, they were super friendly, they had fast replies when we had questions and easy instructions! They really go above and beyond to make your airbnb stay an excellent experience. We would love to stay here again for the next visit!"
35265089,568708960,,233559789,Lesly,"Brian’s place exceeded my expectations! My boyfriend and I enjoyed our stay. I would like to highlight the following: <br/>-Location (the metro bus stop is literally in front of the apt, which saved a ton on money on transportation around Seattle)<br/>-Check-in (it was a breeze and convenient to get in and out of the apt with a code)<br/>-Privacy (the private room had so much privacy and the restroom was located next to the room)<br/>-Views (we had access to the rooftop patio and the view of downtown Seattle was amazing!)<br/>-The cat (We will miss sweet Hammond. He always greeted us at the door. He’s a cool cat!)<br/>Overall, I am so happy I booked Brian’s place. Communication was great and he was extremely flexible with our times. I highly recommend this place for your next Seattle trip!"

50051810,4.46E+17,,233964950,Conor,The location of this apartment was great and close to pike place and other fun stops. The view from the patio was beautiful and everything was perfectly clean and ready for us. Would visit again!
19018523,159826931,,23429614,Rachelle,Mark + Kate's place was just as advertised -- exceptionally clean and very comfortable. Someone contacted us several times to make sure we had what we needed. Access was quick and easy. Lovely neighborhood (very quiet) just a short walk to excellent dining and some shopping. Great parks! Thanks again!
31243526,427003740,,234790248,Rory,Perfect location and wonderful property manager. She really goes above and beyond to make your stay welcoming.
49611456,756767014,,234803084,Carl,Convenient location in Belltown amidst great restaurants. Conscientious and considerate hosts. I have a bad back and the bed was firm and in great shape. — That really matters to me as I am often better off on the floor if mattresses sag too much. It was a pleasant stay.
32680074,463649130,,23496311,Robin,Great location close to greenlake and ravenna park. I book through Airbnb a lot and Melissa made it easy. The last night I had 2 friends stay over and I did not know the guest policy or option to add guests. I made a mistake and Melissa was kind enough to charge me a small fee when she could have charged me more. My apologies Melissa and thank you for hosting me. Melissa was a good communicative host and the apartment was clean and in a quiet part by UW. Thank you!
430610,1980521,,2350223,Eric,Great house in one of the better parts of Seattle. Seth was terrific to work with. We would stay here again.
34069890,569847724,,235138896,Colin,"We literally got back from 10months traveling abroad and Susie and Mike’s place was the first place we stayed back home in Seattle while we were house hunting. <br/>Their place is amazing. And we can easily say it was one of the best places we’d stayed in 10 months. <br/>The apartment is fully stocked for whatever you need. Personal touches are everywhere so you don’t feel like you’re living in some drab after-thought of a apartment. It feels like a home. Everything is brand new and in pristine condition. <br/>The kitchenette is set up with everything (cutlery, plates, bowls, utensils of every kind), including a hot plate to make meals. The mini fridge is large enough to store a weeks worth of food. We should know; we did. Plenty of coffee and tea for your day and Tupperware for leftovers. <br/>The room that makes up the living / dining / kitchen space is bright and inviting. Large enough that you don’t feel stuck with others you’re with. The couch is very comfy with warm blankets. The TV operates on a regular antennae or Chrome Stick so make sure you can “cast” things from whatever devices you have if you feel the need for video entertainment. <br/>The bedrooms are large and well thought out. Each with a closet and dresser. Plenty of hangers for clothes. The master has a private 1/2 bath. Beds and pillows are super comfy without being too soft; we prefer a slightly firm mattress. <br/>The bathrooms like the kitchen, are fully stocked with everything and well maintained and clean. Towels are new and fresh. <br/>Outside there is ample parking for multiple vehicles on the street. The neighborhood is quiet and a quick 20min drive to downtown Ballard where all the bars and restaurants are or a 10min drive to Greenwood or more bars and restaurants are located. <br/>Really we cannot say enough good things about our stay. Aside from the apartment being great Susie and Mike are also amazing people. Easy to get along with and to have a conversation with; you’ll feel like a fiend immediately. <br/>We would happily stay here again and are glad we had the privilege of being their first guests!"
6202214,32781121,,23639444,Samantha,"My stay at Peggy's was a great experience, very private and comfortable. The space was beautiful and the convince of a washer/dryer was a huge plus. Wallingford is a beautiful area, walking distance to the park and local shops. Wonderful place to stay!"
49403667,759365099,,23639872,Carma,"You will love the personal touches. Even nicer than the photos, super comfy space and king bed. Nice location. <br/>Tell us, how is your wifi so fast? <br/>Most of all we loved meeting the hens, coffee on the patio and fresh eggs. THANK YOU!"

53404873,7.64E+17,,2382292,Adam,"Michael’s apartment is lovely and in a very peaceful neighborhood. The photos on airbnb are nice but genuinely we were surprised at just how nice, light and spacious the apartment was. We stayed here for 3 weeks and it was just like home. <br/>The garden with bbq and hot tub were nice too :)<br/>Micheal is extremely communicative and accessing/vacating the apartment was a breeze. <br/>Already planning staying on my next visit."
8515408,50568620,,23828800,Aaron,Jennifer was a fantastic host and resource to all things Queen Anne/Seattle. The neighborhood is VERY walkable and public transportation is accessible. The living space was extremely comfortable and well appointed. I would highly recommend this apartment!
22106598,4.94E+17,,2384490,Yizhou,"We stayed at Alex’s place for a month. Everything is great, we love the layout of the place, location, and both Alex and his sister are super nice. We would recommend this place for your upcoming Seattle stay."
1136522,5928203,,2389526,Alicia,"My husband and I stayed here during a last minute trip to Seattle to visit friends. We really enjoyed our stay here. Melissa was very easy to work with and very accommodating. Pictures are accurate. Very clean apartment and bed is super comfortable! We had a car with us, so we found the location to be very convenient to everywhere we wanted to go. I would recommend this apartment to others.<br/><br/><br/>Tips: If you are a light sleeper I would recommend sleeping with the bedroom windows closed. There is a restaurant nearby that gets early morning deliveries (5am) on certain days. With the window closed you can't hear a thing, but with it open you may get briefly disturbed by the delivery truck while it's unloading.<br/><br/>Also, there are a lot of really great, inexpensive restaurants right by the University. Definitely check them out if you wind up staying here."

5.86E+17,6.7E+17,,241275701,Chris,"Suki’s home is way beyond expectation. As a family that frequents the Seattle area, we stay in a lot of Airbnbs. <br/> And you won’t find another place in Seattle of this value. A stunning 3 story with a rooftop deck! <br/> Every single room was put together with care and class. High end finishes and floor to ceiling windows throughout. <br/> We were worried about parking in the area but was pleasantly surprised that we never had an issue with parking and we had 2 vehicles. <br/> Right across the street from one of the city’s biggest parks for the kids, endless amount of restaurants and bars in walking distance. <br/> Had some friends over for a rooftop wine and dinner overlooking the city. Can’t say enough great things about this place. Will be a stay we won’t forget. Thank you Suki!"

Not only were they fantastic and communicative but extremely generous and put a lot of thought in making their place as enjoyable as possible! It was an absolute pleasure and joy to explore Seattle and come back to such a well furnished, clean, and cozy place. The neighborhood is also amazing and close to the water. Highly recommend checking this place out"
7995944,45201323,,2414844,Jocelyn,"Matt and Rose welcomed us with the perfect balance of helpfulness respecting our privacy for a getaway in the city! The organic coffee, organic tea, and other organic snacks in the kitchen, and natural soaps throughout, were just part of the many little details that made this a sweet little spot. Tall people should know the ceiling is a bit low in the stairs and kitchen area, though I would still heartily recommend staying here!"

The house was very clean and provided almost everything you needed, from kitchen to bathroom to bedroom. We were in Seattle for the University of Washington hospital and we were literally a straight shot away from it. You are also just minutes away from the Northgate mall as well as a quick drive to downtown Seattle. Would definitely stay here again!!"

4693488,25795041,,24411652,Jeff,"Chris and his family are extremely nice, and he did his best to make sure the apartment had everything we needed and that we enjoyed our month long visit. We were the first to stay here, so there were some kitchen items that I think he just forgot to stock. We let him know and in a couple of hours he was there with the things we needed! He had clearly put some effort into making sure things were ready for us, providing several pages of info about the nearby businesses, as well as a welcome basket of drinks and snacks! <br/><br/>The place was clean, and looked just like advertised. As the description mentions, tall people (like me!) will have to be careful and duck in a few places. <br/><br/>The neighborhood is great. It's a quiet residential area, with plentiful street parking, but one block up the road is Greenwood Ave with lots of shops and restaurants. If you want to head towards Fremont or Downtown, you can walk to both the 5 bus (closest) and E bus a little farther. <br/><br/>All in all it was a great place to stay and beats the heck out of a hotel! Thanks Chris!"
34283658,468087052,,244417031,Amal,Sean was very accommodating. The place was clean and comfortable. He communicated with us very well and quick to respond if we needed anything. Provided us with local tips and made the trip all the more pleasant. Would highly recommend!

This studio apartment-esque space was conveniently located in North East Seattle, and with the creative decor, generous amenities, and welcoming hosts, it really felt like home away from<br/>home. <br/>Upon arrival, the check in was easy and quick (access by keypad), and even though I got to the house pretty late, both hosts came down to greet me. The apartment itself was immaculate, clearly having been cleaned recently. What I especially enjoyed was the little touches the hosts included in the apartment, from an adorable (and cohesive!) tennis theme in their decor, simple amenities like hair ties and cotton pads, and activity guides for exploring the city. <br/>However, what really pushed this stay to the next level was the sleeping arrangement. On top of the chic decor in the bedroom, the mattress was absolutely HEAVENLY. Talk about the best night of sleep. Ever. After a long 6-hour flight, having a super restful and comfortable night of rest was absolutely fantastic and was the perfect kickoff to a wonderful trip. <br/>Overall, it was a phenomenal stay. I took a risk in booking a newly listed place and I’m so glad I did! Staying here was better than any hotel experience I could’ve had in the city. <br/>TL;DR: Book this Airbnb! 10/10"
48585796,5.7E+17,,24464725,Rui,"Great place to live. The apartment is at the center of everything: landmarks, markets, groceries, etc. Super valuable price point, and great amenities in the building. We used the jacuzzi pretty much everyday. Definitely recommend this apartment to everyone!"
44037101,649145098,,244663042,Angelica,I won't say I've been to a lot of Airbnb's but I have been to a few in the Seattle area. Lynh's place is the most beautiful home we have stayed at. It's small and cosy yet elegant. It has everything you need and more. I loved that it had Hulu and Disney+ on the TV for my 4 year old and the room controlled temperature is amazing. It's fairly close to wherever you need. You could walk to Safeway for your quick needs and they have other little shops around. Over all a great place and absolutely loved it! Would definitely like to stay here again.
4629020,34114170,,24477206,Denis,"I have stayed in Joy’s apartment for 5 months, and I have sincerely enjoyed living there. The place is very comfortable and well furnished. The apartment contains everything that is needed to feel home, including an oven, a microwave, a refrigerator, a dishwasher, a TV, a washer and a dryer. Everything functioned well and was clean. <br/><br/>Joy is also a very nice host. She made me feel welcome and was easy to reach if there was any problem. It always was a pleasure to talk with her.<br/><br/>The neighborhood is simply ideal. Every house seems to have beautiful gardens with tall trees and various flowers; this apartment’s garden is no exception! Whenever the sky is clear, one has a wonderful view on Mount Rainier from the apartment’s balcony. While the neighborhood is very quiet, there are grocery stores, cafés and restaurants nearby. Downtown Seattle can also be reached conveniently after only a short bus ride."
34097274,506494284,,245241298,William,"Daniel's place was everything described and more! I stayed for 3 months, and the entire stay was very pleasant. The place is in a great location, had an amazing view, and was extremely comfortable. It was clean and had all of the amenities listed. Even more, Daniel was a great host with his friend Kyle. They were quick to communicate on any issues and tried to solve the problem as fast as possible. These two gentlemen are caring people and they take care of their place as well as their guests! Definitely worth a stay!"
15028921,128166499,,24594603,Somin,"I had a great experience at Kate's cottage. The location is amazing, near UW right in the middle of Wallingford area where there are restaurants, coffeeshops, park and QFC in walking distance. The cottage was very new, nice and clean with hardwood floors, brand-new appliances, and high ceilings. Kate was a great communicator, and she made sure I had everything I needed during the entire stay. I would definitely stay here again and would recommend this place to anyone."
46733802,716987168,,246380528,Kristi,Gilberto's home is perfect! It was nice and cozy warm after our long drive. Beds were comfortable and the house was so clean. You can't get any better of a location being so close to the ocean and so many restaurants. Check in was a breeze we had everything we needed from Gilberto in plenty of time. Gilberto was extremely accommodating as we did have several mishaps before arriving. he was understanding and very quick to reply. We will DEFINITELY stay here again. Price is GREAT as well!
14872823,114215859,,2464885,Thiemo,"Thank you Eric & Alexis, I had a great stay at your place. Pet Jack's belly for me ;-)"
461234,1451239,,2465763,Mike,"Rented this Guest Apt. for my daughter, her fiance and my 4 month old grandson who visited from Califorina. Diana is just wonderful and made them feel like family. The Browns Guest Apt. is just amazing. The back yard had a very country like feel. I live only a mile away and I want to stay here myself!!! This was a very good experence for both me and my family. I highly recomend it to anyone!"
52594415,4.82E+17,,246646865,Bryce,"Great Fremont location, excellent communication, loved the place!"
7245581,73148320,,2466479,Ben,The house is indeed in a convenient location right next to shopping mall and a short walk to university. I am not driving so this is perfect for me.
14577606,98745829,,24674580,XiaoLe,Eric is very welcoming. His daughter is a pleasant and responsible young lady. I love his garden and enjoyed the tomatoes.
35678119,512746396,,247130013,Cindy,A great stay that's close enough to the city but far enough to enjoy a nice evening stroll along the lake. Place was extremely quaint and welcoming. Hosts were very quick to response and as welcoming as the 2 cats there.
40681715,623472321,,247276727,Janet,Very nice house with amazing views. Ten of my family members and I stayed there and everyone loved it. There I a nice hiking spot near by.
49548869,756849365,,247359196,Clayton,"Lisa’s Garden cottage was absolutely fantastic. Her place was perfectly clean, equipped with all necessities, was in a wonderful location and was very quiet/private! We were met with a list of local restaurants and a bottle of wine for our stay, which was so thoughtful. It was everything we could have hoped for in an Airbnb. We will definitely be staying there again!"
7.09E+17,7.15E+17,,247440332,Breanne,This home was absolutely amazing!
5104918,30330661,,2474952,Tyler,"Excellent experience! Highly recommended! I had an amazing and relaxing time staying there 2 weeks for work, I thoroughly enjoyed it. I'm definitely going to miss waking up with the view of the morning sun on the water, watching the rowing teams go by while I drank my morning coffee, and the twinkling lights across the water at night. It was very quiet and still a quick 15 min walk to my job in U District across the bridge. <br/><br/>Everything was brand new and exactly as pictured (I was the first guest). Everything I needed was there and more. If you like brand new everything, this is the place for you. <br/><br/>The neighborhood is pretty sleepy, nice and quiet and away from the noise and riff raff, and at the same time it's centrally located and very close to other more vibrant neighborhoods. Definitely walkable to plenty of places in neighboring hoods.<br/><br/>Dennis was an excellent host, very responsive, and a pleasure to work with. Can't recommend this listing enough!"
32454401,452281080,,247872178,Austin,She’s very nice and had everything I needed and more. The place was in a great location which is what I loved the most. Great hospitality
45215321,5.75E+17,,247989754,Grace,"My partner and I stayed here for an extended time and it was absolutely perfect. The apartment itself is clean, beautifully furnished, and everything feels brand new. Our favorite details were the incredible view of the water and the mountains on a clear day right from our couch, and the convenience of the washer and dryer right in the unit. The building is gorgeous, secure, with a fantastic front desk staff and unbeatable rooftop. We hope we're lucky enough to be back again for an even longer stay down the line!"
40952685,751033667,,24802395,Collin,"Clean, cozy and comfortable. We really enjoyed our stay at the tiny house. Great location if you are looking for a short drive to great activities in Seattle with coffee shops and restaurants within walking distance. Cary was an excellent communicator and made the check-in/check-out process smooth. We would stay here again!"
47002843,728244847,,24917508,Krysten,"Steven’s place is great. <br/>- Well-appointed.<br/>- Great neighborhood! And safe! <br/>- One parking spot included (note, it’s pretty small - anything larger than a midsize suv would not fit). <br/>- Modern & stylish. <br/>- Very clean. <br/>Steven was a fabulous host with great communication. We would definitely stay here again!! <br/>Only con: The townhome sits on a moderately trafficked street. The road noise woke us up a few times at night."
44599664,652372240,,249712769,Beau,Melissa is amazing. Never had any problems reaching out to her. She went above and beyond for my stay.
3022564,14102049,,2497238,Cody,"My wife and I stayed at Marcus & Lara's for 3 nights and had a fantastic stay at their studio. Marcus was super easy to communicate with and quick to respond. The studio is exactly how the pictures look and is perfect for a travelling couple. The place was super clean and has a very comfortable bed. Parking is right beside the unit. We found the location to be excellent with many restaurants, pubs and coffee shops a block and a half away. It is only about a 10 minute drive into the city or there is a train station only 4 blocks away which takes you right into downtown Seattle. Also a 2 minute drive takes you down to beautiful parks along Lake Washington. We are looking forward to our next stay at their studio the next time we are in Seattle. Thanks again Marcus and Lara!"
11302585,72480495,,24987753,Sarah,"Staying at this cute little apartment was perfect for our girls getaway weekend! The photos accurately portray the apartment, and it had everything we needed to enjoy ourselves. The bed was comfy, and we liked that everything was new/modern. The location is perfect! Loads of bars, restaurants, and shops within walking distance. There's also a grocery store a few blocks away. There were 3 of us staying there, and we were all very comfortable. I think it would be just as comfortable if we added a 4th person. Highly recommend this spot! Thanks, Cate!"
33079505,435226590,,250177434,Hugo,Great place and great host
5174876,27738950,,25045152,Mesay,"We enjoyed staying in this studio. It’s located in central part of Seattle close to downtown and Broadway Street. Amble free street parking available.<br/>The studio itself is very clean and as advertised. Plenty of light in the kitchen and sitting area. The bed is very comfortable – as good as a 4 star hotel. <br/>All in all, we were very pleased with the hosts and the place. Our demands were met in a timely manner. I would stay here again. <br/>"
49447838,6.82E+17,,250948172,Virginia,Beautiful place with a great location that is just around the corner to Pike Place market and the waterfront. Wonderful stay!
38734769,555594622,,250996157,Ankita,"Loved Grace's house. It was such a cute place, more than sufficient for the five of us and was packed to the brim with different amenities. From varieties of tea, to stacks of board games, everything that we were provided with was incredibly appreciated. As a host as well, Grace was easy to communicate with and helped with making check-in/check out super smooth. Don't think twice if you're looking to stay here, you will not regret it!"
48377965,743238561,,250997356,Rachel,Very beautiful and comfortable home. Quick walk to some restaurants and cute local shops. Also very close to university square with more shopping and food. Short drive to downtown for all the tourist things to do and see. Mary provides all the basics and some nice little touches like coffee creamer! Parking is very tight. We were expecting this but having a large suburban was a challenge but not impossible.
723846,3451200,,2511088,Tara,"I rented this cute little cottage for two months. The space is very clean and the design is very well thought out. It is quiet, peaceful, quaint, and in a safe area. You will not find better hosts, Cheryl and Steve are incredibly nice and accommodating. Their house sits in front of the cottage and are easily reachable should you need them, but you will feel 100% in your own world. Absolutely a fantastic space and amazing family!"
33350586,453780483,,251140174,Mohamed,"My girlfriend and I had a great stay at Daniel's place. The location was great since it was very central to Downtown and West Seattle. The place itself was very clean, stylish, and had basically everything we needed. Daniel was also a great host who was incredibly accommodating, especially during check-in and check-out."
4881141,134735230,,25115314,John,"This spot is very inviting, comforting, and roomy for up to 4 or 5 individuals. It is within a 3 minute walk from the water. I would recommend a walk just before sunset. Within a 5 minute drive, there is a vast selection of restaurants, bars, coffee shops, and stores. My favorite was the local record shop/coffee shop/cafe combined into one. There is also a local farmer's market on the weekend (check schedule).<br/>Dave, the host, is very accommodating if you need anything. He makes sure you are introduced to the place, comfortable, and have what you need. Besides that, the place felt as if it were ours. There are no overlapping common spaces. We made ourselves at home for a month while hunting for a permanent place to live. I would definitely stay again.<br/>Thanks Dave!"
31361577,467654422,,251237941,Anna,"Great space, love the birds chirping outside the room. Great location!"
392779,1434935,,2512670,Frank,"Great downstairs in-law like option with plenty of room. The hosts were very welcoming and provided suggestions on local places to eat since we arrived late in the day. We drove by car from here to downtown Seattle, which was a very short jaunt. There's also a transit station nearby if you don't have a car or don't want to pay for downtown parking. Overall, would recommend and stay again."
4279578,22046490,,2515303,Erika,"My dad stayed in this beautiful little place while he was visiting me from out of state, and he absolutely loved it. He couldn't say enough about how warm and cozy it is, how incredible the location is, how helpful Donna was, and how he cannot wait to return for another stay. Regarding my own interactions with Donna (I booked it for my dad), she went out of her way to make everything perfect and comfortable for him...I absolutely recommend this awesome deal to anyone looking for an incredible location near the lake, a wonderful host, and adorable accommodations."
54069990,5.4E+17,,251678469,Calista,"Joanne was a great host, and this place was perfect. We had to schedule it with pretty little notice (we are Seattle residents, just needed a place to stay for a bit), and Joanne was super communicative and helpful. The home is beautiful, and the full kitchen was awesome. Thanks for having us!!"
34693229,462077080,,251732339,Nataliia,"The master bedroom has huge walk in closet with hangers and mirror. There are desk and office chair if you need to work. The lights in both closet and bedroom can be controlled with a remote and have motion sensors which is a nice feature. <br/>The kitchen is equipped with a set of plates/cups/silverware and some pans and oven dishes as well as toaster and coffee maker. The host readily provided me with additional utensils that I needed for cooking.<br/>There is a washer/drier in this quest suit which is used by quests only.<br/>The only issue for me was the AC/heater. The suit is located on a basement level so, naturally, during the warm weather the temperature there is always lower than that on a main living level of a house. There is no separate thermostat in a basement so AC/heater turns on/off based on a main house level temperature. I felt pretty cold during my stay. However, the host provided me with additional blanket so I could sleep more comfortably at night.<br/>The location is pretty convenient. It is a five minutes walk to the bus that takes you directly to downtown/pike place area. The neighborhood is very nice when all the trees and rhododendrons are blossoming"
493591,1518208,,2518092,Rob & Allison,"Flor makes everyone feel like family. She is a perfect host. She is married to the famous Nacho Libre who was also so welcoming when we arrived, helping us to get our bags upstairs as well as loaded into the car when we left. <br/> <br/>Flor is a great cook, preparing an awesome breakfast in the morning and making us feel like royalty. Flor even drove us to the airport when we left. All we can say is Flor is the best and her home is conveniently located to get around Seattle without any problems."
21515448,221487101,,25198383,Mike,Outstanding view and great location!
49030370,759370756,,252026628,Samantha,"This place was incredible to stay out! The house is well kept and clean, Rose provided extra items in case you needed anything- toothbrushes, snacks & coffee! She was amazing at communicating & suggested a ton of great local restaurants. The place is in the perfect location & a few minute walk to restaurants & link. She added a birthday touch to a great weekend. Definitely recommend staying here!"
8409750,51998291,,25222010,Andrew,Gayle was incredibly helpful in making our Seattle experience a success. The apartment is truly a experience and in a prime location downtown. Having private parking was also a privilege and made things pretty care free if you don't mind taking a walk. I would recommend to anyone ready to experience Seattle.
26996748,317192414,,25242500,Dennis,Karen was a great host! She was very helpful in providing extra directions even when we arrived late in the night. The place is super new and clean. She even left fresh flowers in the room which I thought was super sweet!

41598064,598207340,,252892873,Melissa,"Easy check in, good communication, and a clean, comfortable room. Everything was exactly as advertised. I wouldn’t hesitate to stay here again."
24991392,9.47E+17,,25316705,Kay,"I was lucky enough to book Andrew’s place for 5 weeks and loved it! The location is amazing. I had a car but it would definitely be doable without one, as both the light rail and grocery store (as well as restaurants/coffee shops) are an easy walk. The cottage is on its own lot, with a lovely yard surrounding it and a nice back porch area, which was great during the summer weather. It has both a dishwasher and washer/dryer, which was very handy. Andrew is in the house just across the alley and was an excellent host—very responsive and on top of things, friendly yet very respectful of privacy too. I would definitely recommend this Airbnb to other travelers. Thanks again, Andrew!"
16000566,133116721,,25323058,Vijay,Michael's place is great. In a very convenient location where it is really easy to catch a bus to get anywhere. It's also within walking distance of several places to eat and grab some coffee.
48642000,763808567,,25323566,Brittany,I stayed with my friend and his dog at Christopher’s place. I was welcomed into the suite with a lovely gift basket for both human and pup. The suite was spotless all around and had everything we needed to make for the best Seattle trip possible. Christopher was very attentive and helped us outside of normal host duties and ensured all bases were covered. We were also within walking distance of Trader Joe’s and many dining locations. I hope to stay again soon. Thanks Christopher!
15178392,108643357,,25335545,Richard,"Matthews place is absolutely incredible - the location is quite simply the best for access to all downtown amenities with a spectacular view of the harbour and Islands! Lovely living space and the bed is one the best I've ever slept on - no mean feat, given I have travelled the world over and stayed in 100's of hotels. Can't wait to return!"
33149601,440397822,,253540393,Sarah,Small but super clean and nice and a great area!
7.24E+17,8.3E+17,,25366178,Justin,Wonderful stay! The home looks just like the pictures and was perfect for my wife and I. It was filled with all the amenities we needed. The host was kind and helpful. Would recommend to anyone needing long term stay!
47908013,754816671,,25370476,Houda,"We stayed at My Nhung’s place for an entire month as we were working remote. And we ABSOLUTELY loved it. We stayed in the upstairs unit which was recently remodeled and has absolutely everything we needed (and beyond).<br/>Location is perfect, near everything (within 10-15 min drive), yet felt very peaceful. The Internet was working perfectly and didn’t encounter any issues while working remote. Echoing what other people said before: the listing description is accurate: very clean, cosy, well lit, fully stocked kitchen, laundry in the basement, heat in every room, 2 bedrooms with queen beds, including 1 BR with a desk, large dining room table (could also be used a second desk if needed), driveway (and available street parking if needed). We very much enjoyed the yard (and all the chickens), the neighborhood: diverse, cute and very tranquil with a nearby coffee place (Flora bakehouse, couple streets away) and several restaurants (in Georgetown, less than 5min drive away).<br/>My Nhung is a GREAT host (she deserves her superhost badge), very warm personality, and will go out of her way to help you. She was also flexible for our check out time. I will definitely stay here again if I ever come back to Seattle. <br/>Highly recommend this place !! Don’t hesitate, book it! You will love it."
19272024,171056769,,25386047,Erica Aisleen,"The garden apartment was perfect for my husband and I. It was in a quiet area of West Seattle, 25-30 min from downtown Seattle. The apartment was very clean, had a spacious kitchen, comfy bed, extra blankets, washing machine... anything you could need to feel comfortable and at home during your stay. The hosts put in extra effort leaving notes on how thing worked and where to find anything we needed. They even had local coffee and cookies for us to have. They were very easy to contact and replied to emails promptly. James met us on our first day for checkin. In the apartment he has hiking guides marked with different hikes he recommended and a list of restaurants close by to try. <br/>My husband and I had an amazing time and would wholeheartedly recommend this garden apartment to anyone traveling to the Seattle area!"

24865391,282233857,,2541731,Matthew,"It's hard to articulate how much Anne's lovely space exceeded my - very high - expectations. The space was wonderful, spacious, exceptionally well furnished, in a great location and amazingly clean.<br/>Anne had done everything to make our stay wonderful and I appreciated every little touch and her flawless attention to detail.<br/>As a host, Anne was great with communication and while staying completely out of our way, made herself available at any time if we needed assistance. <br/>Due to her thorough preparation and anticipation of our every need, we didn't have a single issue with our stay.<br/>I cannot recommend Anne's place enough."

16000373,133615751,,25460497,Blanca,"Lovely house in a very tranquil neighborhood. At a walking distance from Capitol Hill's bars and restaurants, and only 30 minutes walk from Down Town. Plenty of shops and supermarkets nearby. Michael was very responsive every time we contacted him. The house was very clean and had everything we could need for a very pleasant stay. We would definitely recommend this place if you want to visit Seattle and enjoy quiet nights!"
33877230,456040933,,25475745,Ashley,"My boyfriend and I stayed at Katya's apartment this past weekend and had the most amazing experience. <br/>Before our arrival, Katya was quick to answer any questions I had. When checking in we were greeted with the warmest welcome. The fireplace was lit, fresh flowers were on the on the coffee table, soft music was playing, there was water and wine in the refrigerator, a continental breakfast with locally made croissants, and a hand written card from Katya welcoming us. We were blown away by Katya's hospitality! <br/>I highly recommend staying at Katya's apartment, whether your trip is for a quick weekend getaway or a longer. The apartment is in a quiet and beautiful location and is very close to the UW campus & University Village. The kitchen is stocked with any kitchen supply you may need, and Katya's attention to detail makes her home very cozy and relaxing. <br/>Thank you again Katya!

2976798,25516831,,25616702,Harri,"This was my first time using air Bnb and I loved it. My gf and I stayed in Patricia's place for one weekend. Not like the picture shown, the place is actually pretty spaceful. We got to use the private bathroom and a study room next to the bedroom. Patricia was very friendly and helpful. She listed all the good places to visit for us and stocked the fridge with snacks. Public transportation is good around the area(near UW). A lot of buses go through this place so busing to downtown should be around 20min. Anyways, I had a wonderful stay and hope more people would come to Patricia's!"
44570566,728762065,,25641155,Carol Ann,Mardy & Kate are gracious hosts! Their home is nicely appointed and very comfortable. I highly recommend! 5??

The location is perfect, easy access to downtown, close to restaurants etc in Columbia City and the light rail is super close. Having off-street parking is a HUGE plus as Seattle parking can sometimes be a pain. The apartment itself has everything you might need and more. It is gorgeous and comfortable. We slept great in the amazing bed!"
34571618,465987455,,256543276,Matthew,Clean and friendly! Quick and helpfulin responding to questions.
6.11E+17,6.85E+17,,25657010,Taylor,Lynne is an all-star host and offered great recommendations for our girl's trip to Seattle. She not only gave us full service but everything was a breeze when it came to checking in and checking out. Within walking distance of major sites. Great space for anyone looking to visit Seattle for the first (or fifth) time.
37715703,626674428,,25699565,Pia,"Thank you so much, Carrie. We had a wonderful time in this cottage. <br/>Everything was incredibly clean, and beyond beautiful. Carrie was very responsive and helpful. She left hand picked flowers in the cottage, and a list of helpful tips and restaurants around the area. The house is so beautiful with sweet touches that made us feel welcomed and comfortable. Very recommended! I will for sure be contacting Carrie again."
10790541,521282026,,257405242,Reggie,"My stay at Kari's place was fantastic. I stayed for about two months while I was working a summer internship and it exceeded my expectations. My room was very clean, comfortable, nicely furnished, and it had plenty of storage space which was a big plus for me. All of the shared spaces for this listing (bathroom, kitchen, laundry) also worked out great and were well-maintained. Kari was also super helpful and communicative from the first booking, all the way through my stay. I didn't know the neighborhood well before-hand, but West Seattle is a really cool area; while the listing is in a pleasant, quiet area, you're a 5-minute drive from a bunch of restaurants and stores in the West Seattle area, and not far from SoDo or even downtown (which you can also bus to easily). For me, it was a really convenient location to commute to places like Renton south of the city while being able to dodge traffic. Again, hard to say what could have been better about my stay at Kari's; I highly recommend it."
21205931,205823668,,25752537,Lynn,"This is a delightful oasis in Seattle. There are beautiful gardens with sitting area outside the good size studio. We appreciated the well lit path to the entrance since we arrived after dark. The interior is modern, beautifully decorated with a fully equipped kitchen and eating area, a large bathroom as well as a sweet sitting area by a gas fireplace. The bay window seat overlooks the garden, a lovely place to read the morning paper with a cup of coffee (so many details to make our stay comfortable including good coffee and breakfast items!) . We appreciated the privacy of the studio but also Bob's availability to answer our questions about the area. We will be back! Thanks, Bob! Lynn"
7.43E+17,7.59E+17,,25770061,Yvonne,"What a beautiful new suite in one of Seattles most charming neighborhoods. We found the unit exactly as it looked on line. Beds were comfortable, the kitchen well stocked - although we were not there to cook. We got up and enjoyed a run around the lake and stopped at a local coffee shop. Our visit was too short and can’t wait to go back!"
37300439,506586241,,25815312,Jeff,"We had a fantastic stay at Will and Jimi's place. I believe we were their first guests in this unit. They went above and beyond in every way. Their communication ahead of time was fantastic. They made sure we knew exactly what to expect, and we felt like we were personal friends coming for a visit when we arrived. But they also gave us all the privacy we wanted. They live close by, but didn't bother us a bit unless we needed something.<br/>The condo was very well appointed. Plenty of linens and towels, a well stocked kitchen, Wi-Fi, extra toiletries in the bathroom. We've stayed in many Airbnbs, and this was as well appointed as any we've been in.<br/>The location was probably the best feature. It is in a nice complex, made up of four buildings. There is a gym, pool, hot tubs and saunas, and a rooftop common area. The alley between the buildings is Post Alley! You are only a few blocks from Pike Place, and you are midway between Seattle Center and the Stadiums. It's the perfect spot for the Seattle experience.<br/>We would happily stay there again (and we plan to!). I should mention that it is sort of a cross between a studio and a one bedroom. The beds aren't totally separated from the living area. There is a partial wall, but no door. It's great for a couple or a family of three or four. It would be pretty cozy for two couples."
48714907,756172805,,2583352,Carrie,"I can’t imagine a better way to celebrate seeing my family again after a very long year. My mom and sister and I were stunned when we pulled up to the La Rustica Villa and realized we were staying here! The villa is EXTRAORDINARY, a true visual feast. It is filled with unique, gorgeous art with a clever balance of whimsey and opulence. Furnished to take advantage of the generous space, there are many cozy little nooks to relax in with a book or a beverage. There is even a grand piano in the living room downstairs!<br/>The location of the Villa is absolutely spectacular. With an unobstructed view of the Puget Sound, our happy hour stretched into many happy hours as we sat on the upstairs veranda watching boats and wildlife. The neighborhood is quiet, perfect for leisurely walks along the waterfront, and within walking distance to Alki Beach shops and dining. There is also a wonderful Italian restaurant directly across the street, perfect for an intimate meal at the restaurant or takeout to enjoy in the villa. <br/>Marlow is truly a super host who has thought of everything. She was very responsive to all of my messages and clearly communicated everything we needed to know about the villa. The frig and cupboards were stocked with all the essentials we’d need, from coffee and creamer, to spices, popcorn and little chocolates, to dishware and cooking equipment. We ordered the optional charcuterie, which was lovingly assembled and had more than enough to keep us nibbling for days. The bathrooms were stocked with luxurious soaps, shampoos, sprays and other necessities. We especially loved the spacious downstairs walk-in shower with its Tuscan tilework.<br/>We loved every minute of being here together to celebrate Mother’s Day and our Mom’s Birthday and hope to return soon!!!"
26135947,318508969,,25842137,Kelsey,"Wow! How lucky were we to stay at Sandra’s place. We saw her new listing and thought we would try it out since our trip was last minute. Even though the pictures are great, the space is even better. The entire renovated basement has such a great amount of space and Sandra included all the thoughtful touches. The keypad locks made for easy entry and exit and driveway parking was wonderful. Her thoughtful touches such as the nespresso machine was awesome for morning coffee (and we love coffee). Highly recommend staying here. You can easily access Greenlake and other major highways for traveling around the city. The renovations were beautiful and we even took notes for some decorative touches we want to have in our new space. Look forward to coming back soon!"
10814218,63765751,,2584701,Jeanne,"Mel was delightful, friendly, gracious and very knowledgeable about The neighborhood and The Seattle area.<br/><br/>Apartment was lovely, bright, super clean and better furnished then my apartment."
13157632,94383892,,25857521,Julia,"Melissa's apartment was very clean and more spacious than it looks in the pictures. We only visited for a couple of days, so we didn't use the kitchen (or the huge closet), but it looked very functional for short- or longer-term stays. It's really convenient for public transit as well!"
9.77E+17,9.89E+17,,258667284,Peach,"Nice place to stay, great hosts. Communicated very well."
46058912,706966345,,258871567,Esther,The best location in Greenlake!!
7.54E+17,8.02E+17,,259527918,Aisaku,"Overall a great stay. Amy was super helpful, the location is amazingly convenient, room was great, etc etc. The only downside is that the bathroom is a bit tight, shower has weak water pressure, and I’d recommend changing the shower curtain a bit more periodically. That being said, the pros outweigh the cons by a long shot. I would definitely recommend staying here."
5299060,28155455,,25956292,Em,"Dan was a wonderful host! He was very kind and welcoming, and has the cutest dog! This place was amazing, Dan is a much better host than photographer, the pictures don't do it justice! Will be back again for sure."
491958,1667700,,2595909,Alyson,"Jay, Colleen, Mica & Gigi-dog were excellent hosts! They welcomed us with warm and cheerful greetings as well as a delicious treat from the local bakery! They even delivered us a fan when the weather was projected to climb above 75, which was so considerate, although, the majority of the trip we thoroughly enjoyed having all the windows open to allow for the cool & crisp Seattle breeze to set the temperature of the apartment. Jay took the time to share some gems with us on good places to eat, event happenings and must-do activities in the charming Columbia City area as well as greater Seattle. After that, they allowed us total privacy in our treehouse apartment retreat. The apartment was our perfect home away from home after expoloring all that Columbia City and Seattle has to offer. In Columbia City, we hit up the local Farmer's Market, listened to some great live music during Beatwalk, perused the little shops and galleries and enjoyed delicious coffee and meals all within walking distance of the house. The location is convenient to the major highways as well, so downtown and the airport were extremely accessible and just a quick 10-15 minute drive. The apartment is just as described and pictured, immaculately clean with all the bases covered. The bed was extrmemely plush and comfortable, probably some of the best sleep we've had in a long while. We had a truly wonderful experience and would highly recommend Jay and his Columbia City Treehouse to anyone visiting Seattle!"
34623511,474089472,,259982999,Alec,Very responsive. Would stay again.
33020993,469503896,,259986302,Rebecca,Awesome house and the host was fantastic!
30775742,402216179,,26014275,Ciara,"Comfortable, cozy, and a super well equipped kitchen! I really enjoyed my stay at Joe's! The location was great - only one block from the lake and two blocks from restaurants, coffee shops, and a small grocery store. The place was very clean, perfect for my needs, and Joe was a great host. I slept really well and had room to relax. I'll definitely be coming back!"
19807175,170518545,,26055715,Trish,"This was a really good find. Enormous bedroom and bathroom. Everything was spotlessly clean and suited us perfectly. Free wifi was a great help, and we even had the opportunity to do some washing.<br/>Whilst this is in a private house you are offered total privacy. We walked approximately 30 minutes to the nearest village to eat on our first night, and caught a bus to Downtown Seattle (and back) our second day. The bus stop is right outside the house.<br/>The hosts were delightful and offered many extras and I wish them every success with their future with Airbnb."

29849964,458992940,,26177472,Kiki,"We stayed here for a weekend with our two young kids and had a great time. My kids were enthralled by the fact that the shower looked like a little house (something I hadn’t noticed) but my husband and I were really taken with the deck. The view over the whole of Seattle’s downtown is amazing, especially once the sun goes down and the kids fall asleep. The location is perfect – it’s in Capitol Hill, but just far enough from the bars that there’s no noise. You could easily walk to ten great places for dinner and drinks. The AirBnB is above the hosts’ residential property and has been clearly built for that purpose – there’s a great mini-kitchen and two couples could easily share the rental if you use the couch bed. There’s an elevator to the AirBnB from the ground floor. Ashley and Steve were very accommodating and our stay was easy. Will stay here again for certain – did I mention that the shower looks like a little house?"
20269058,182084401,,26187990,Zhenyu,Great place to stay in Seattle. Close to downtown with variety of shopping malls and restaurants. Room is large and tidy.
13696391,94001895,,26201614,Andrea,"This lovely, well equipped Seattle space is great in sooo many aspects. Driveway and street parking, partnered with easy, safe neighborhood walking and easy access to downtown by car or public transport made it a great choice for our group of 5 women. Dimple was pleasant, responsive and accessible as a hostess. This could easily be advertised as 5 bedrooms with the inclusion of a couple of airbeds for the large empty spaces (we brought our own) and 3-10 occupants could be comfortable. The views of waterfront from the porches were a bonus, as well as easy walkng access to a great local waterfront oyster and cocktail bar complete with Adirondack style seating."
19055403,159841706,,26205951,Rachael,"We had a great stay at Janet's place in Ballard! The apartment was clean and nice, and Janet provided everything we could have needed to enjoy our stay. She is kind and helpful, and very easy to get in touch with at any point during your stay. The neighborhood, Ballard, is very hip and has a lot of cool restaurants, bars, and shops just a short drive away from Janet's place. We would highly recommend!"
33692462,516655352,,262118027,Lauren,"My first experience with AirBnb, and it was great! Kimberley was nice, always quickly resolved any issues, and was great at communicating. Would recommend!"
7922013,58475501,,26276089,Jessica,Had a wonderful stay! Mehrit was a wonderful host. Got us everything we needed and made us feel at home! Thank you!
6492880,33877610,,26322293,Katie And Jason,"Great neighborhood, within walking distance to food and nightlife. We were able to find on-street parking without a problem. The home was super clean and welcoming, the bed comfortable and having Sylvia stick her head out to say hello was great."
45363764,666432744,,26345463,Chris,Fantastic stay at a stylish and clean condo in the heart of Fremont
35162444,470907568,,263742767,Omkar,"We stayed at Prez and Keia's place for a week. Prez was very friendly and respectful of our space. The kitchen was well equipped with utensils, microwave, coffee machine and sauces. The bedrooms were clean and comfortable. I would recommend this place for anyone who wants peace of mind during their stay."
21010058,240924425,,26383615,Peg,"Eleanora was a wonderful, welcoming host and was very responsive to any questions we had. The apartment was incredibly clean, comfortable and spacious. We loved the bright colors and contemporary furnishings. We had no problems with parking. The apartment was easy to get to and conveniently located to shops, restaurants, transportation, etc."
38853614,541738597,,263951103,Katrina,"Where to start? My husband and I decided to go to Seattle to visit friends and found this little westside charmer available that had everything someone would need. We noticed right away that despite the house being on a busy street we didnt hear any street noise once we were inside. Also, I was seriously impressed with how easy it was to find all the amenities they had so thoughtfully placed in the suite. I can attest to the washer and dryer working spot on, too. While we didnt see the hosts very much, they were super easy to get a hold of if we had a question. If we come back to west Seattle we will definitely be staying here again!"
35063529,459068435,,264152197,Megan,"A warm and welcoming space in the heart of Uptown Seattle that makes enjoying local entertainment and food so easy! It's a short walk from the iconic Seattle Center, film and theatre, and delicious restaurants. I loved the vintage decor and art. The host keeps the space very clean and organized, and I felt comfortable using amenities. It's got safe nearby parking that is a rare gem in that part of town. I would stay again and recommend to others any time. Mark was welcoming and had great suggestions for culture and sightseeing. The whole experience is a steal!"
36235581,636261090,,264339923,Miranda,Great play to stay super cute !! Only downside is paying 15 a night for parking
34664482,470980696,,264524731,Cindy,"Lovely house, more than enough room to accommodate the maximum guests allowed. We were in Seattle for the UW graduation and found the location convenient. The patio was the highlight for us, with a BBQ, covered and lighted large seating area it made the evening very enjoyable."
35933365,521285794,,264667892,Shijun,She is a very nice lady that helps me to settle down. The room was not large but I feel like it's my home. Neighbors were very nice and I love that small sofa!
47988489,4.53E+17,,2649020,Michael,"Great airbnb! It's a 7th floor corner unit with a balcony and a great view of the Space Needle! The location is a bit removed from downtown but still just a short walk away. I did a month-long stay by myself, so the studio size was perfect for me. All the amenities were provided, which was amazing. The only downsides are that it's close to a freeway onramp & construction sites, so traffic can be a bit noisy with the window open, but it's fine once you close the windows. For remote workers, there's not a dedicated workstation, so the small table is both your workstation and your kitchen table, which I found annoying but manageable. Also, the building does NOT have a gym! That misleading term was in the title when I reserved it, but as it turned out, I wouldn't have gotten a chance to use it anyway. All in all, great place, and one of my best airbnb experiences! Very easy to recommend!"
40293242,580540070,,265075135,Nathaniel,Great location and view. Very helpful host. Would definitely stay again. Amazing place.
19366629,193748115,,26529315,Siobhan,"The apartment is located very close to the light rail so traveling in town to tourist attractions was very convenient. I was pleasantly surprised with how quick the train was (20 minutes or so to UW).<br/>Their house is in a safe neighborhood with cute town center. The apartment is located at the back of the house on the bottom floor with a private entrance. We could hear some noise overhead as we were going to bed and getting up, but we didn't lose any sleep because of it. <br/>The apartment is very clean and comfortable. Bed and towels were great. The ceilings are a little low but I don't think they'd be a problem unless you're over 6 feet.<br/>Jill let us park in the driveway which was great when the street parking filled up one night. Even after we checked out Jill allowed us to leave the car while we took one last trip in to pioneer square. <br/>Communicating with Jill was super easy over email. She always responded within ten minutes or so. <br/>Overall lovely stay, and exceptional for the price!"
50230521,6.72E+17,,265471109,JoAnn,"This unit was in a nice and safe area - it is a very quiet neighborhood. The unit was clean and comfortable. The only issue we had is with wooden floors upstairs, we still could hear the tenants upstairs. When there's kids upstairs, it can get loud. With the neighborhood being so quiet, we could hear a lot of the upstairs tenants. The wifi is also not very strong. But, we still had a nice time and visited the beach that was close by. It's a beautiful area!"
9512909,56531778,,26603967,Bruce,I had a great stay here. Paul & Izabela were very communicative and kind every step of the way. I would definitely recommend.
28317348,446973958,,26604879,Lynn,Enjoy the very best of Seattle. The apartment will exceed your expectations. Spotless. SUPER comfy bed. Million dollar view from the patio on the beach. Breath and hear Puget Sound. Kitchen has everything you need. Parking right in front of the door. 10 star for me. I loved the place and begged to stay longer. Book it.
9590835,65477681,,26611380,Nick,"The space lived up to its photos and was a little more spacious then expected. Jamie and her boyfriend were great hosts. I felt very comfortable and at home in there downstairs apartment. Microwave,popcorn,mini fridge,tea kettle and a French press and all the amenities you would find at a hotel. <br/>Oh, and a decent little DVDs collection in case ya get bored.<br/>For being there first Airbnb customers they were on point"
12224432,80631038,,2662221,Karen,"From the moment I called to let Norman know we were in town, everything went smoothly. I was provided with detailed directions to his place and was told I could get there anytime, so there wasn't a hard and strict check-in time. The place was even cuter than the pics show. He converted his single-car garage into a fun and cute kitchen, then through another door there is a separate dining area, bathroom, and a large, lower level where the bed, sitting area, and full bath are located. The electric fireplace helped keep the room warm, as it was a bit chilly out. We were provided with eggs, juice, fresh fruit, English muffins, etc. for our enjoyment. Fresh, cut flowers from their garden placed in some of the rooms added a nice touch. The washer and dryer were made available to us, if needed. They also let us use their on-street parking permit so we always had a place to park when we came back at the end of the day. Easy access to and from the freeway. Stay here!"

35042947,463106248,,26713925,Ruth,"Private room/bathroom that had a nice soft bed with plushy pillows! The room had a brand new mini fridge to keep our drinks cold and a dresser to keep all our items spread out to feel like home! The bathroom was fully equipped with a nice showerhead, shamppo/conditioner/body wash/ handsoap! The room felt like a private getaway and less like a hostel type of environment. Would highly recommend this place!!"
5364244,27410896,,26737848,Alex,"This guest house is perfect for a weekend trip or an extended stay. The first floor bedroom is comfortable and quite with a large closet and washer/dryer. The second floor has a small (but very well equipped) kitchen, a full bathroom and large living area space (including TV and WiFi). The skylights all along the ceiling add bright natural light during the day and make it a great spot to spend some time in the morning before heading out. The guest house has a separate entrance from the back of the property and a parking spot, so access was a breeze. <br/><br/>I live in the Loyal Heights neighborhood and can attest to the great location of this guest house (quiet neighborhood that is very convenient to Ballard and an easy trip to downtown). My parents came to visit for an extended stay and really loved the guest house. Considering the quality of the nearby hotels and how expensive the nice ones are this place is a steal. You get a lot of living space for a reasonable rate. Finally, Kassy was very responsive to the questions we had and was easy to work with. We will definitely be using this guest house in the future."
566435,2199790,,2675289,Melanie,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Flor's Place. She is the perfect hostess, so welcoming and friendly and full of great stories. Flor truly made us feel at home, only better because we were treated to her delicious breakfasts each morning, and didn't have to lift a finger. Our conversations over breakfast and afterwards were always a blast, and by the end of our stay we felt like family. <br/><br/>Flor was more than happy to help us any way she could: from picking us up & dropping us off at the airport, to suggestions of where to go and what to see, and how to find the bus. Her house is conveniently located for easy access to the bus routes, but far enough out from the city that it is quiet and relaxed. <br/><br/>I would highly recommend anyone visiting Seattle to stay at Flor's Place. You're in for a treat!"

Great location & extremely clean with an awesome porch and view. Jeremy was very easy to communicate with, and was extremely accommodating throughout our stay. <br/>The studio has a mini kitchenette, with a toaster oven, fridge, microwave, and grill. The grill has a stovetop, so we really were able to cook everything we wanted to. The kitchen sink is small, so if you are planning on doing a lot of cooking, doing dishes can be a little tedious. But it is totally doable and worth it! We had a great stay & would highly recommend!"
8441477,48810474,,27054623,Jeff,"We just spent a delightful 3 nights in Rebecca's home. It was wonderful. The beds were comfy, the linens were even better than ours at home. The home itself is beautiful and very well maintained. Everything worked. Rebecca and her husband Nick are great hosts. We walked to a great bakery, they sent us to a wonderful Italian restaurant for dinner one night in a nearby neighborhood, and they left us with coffee, chocolate and red wine. What more can you ask? The large screen tv with HBO and reliable wifi were also big pluses. As were the showers with great water pressure and temperature. We have had mixed experiences over the years when renting someone's home but this house is special and so are the hosts. We give this our highest rating."

Ron was a great host, he made sure we had everything we needed upon our arrival and was easy to get ahold of should we have needed him. The little flat was great as well! Location was perfect to get to different buses heading into different districts and we loved how simple and cute it was. No complaints! Great place to stay :)"

28214746,324793594,,27118485,Bryan,"You can expect a lovely, clean place with a stellar view of the harbor, great location, walking distance to the downtown, and a quick responsive host full of suggestions."
2069917,26339074,,27133546,Nifemi,My first time with AirBnB and i am glad it was with Anna. Extremely clear instructions and an awesome space. Very good host and very good location.
36037114,479378632,,271381188,Magdalena,"Ian & Jen are very kind, thoughtful, and generous. They're quick to reply and made themselves available for any questions. Everything is so new, modern and practical. I love the rain shower, the sink, pretty much everything! The decor is very detailed and on point ???? Parking is tricky but you'll figured it out. If you're a reader and forgot to bring your books, there are some books to read. This is a basement studio, there were guests at the house and you can hear whenever they walk around but they are also mindful of people below. It was my birthday and they had cupcakes with a little note when I checked-in, it was so sweet of them. Made my staycation and golden birthday special! Definitely will stay there again!"
46026577,707951221,,27191443,Chris,"This Airbnb ROCKS! Such a cute place with easy access to lots of Seattle landmarks. The bedroom is super quiet with a very comfortable bed, and there was plenty of space to spread out. The whole unit is entirely remodeled and is sparkling clean; the shower is heaven, too! We had a great stay and would happily stay again."
30018439,364534623,,27221880,Taylor,"My Fiancé and I have been dreaming of a location like this for awhile! Beautiful view within a stones throw of Pike Place - giving you access to everything that makes it a world renowned Market.<br/>The place is stocked with quality amenities(Sheets, Soaps, Pots&Pans, Couches, TV, Mattress). All items that you would expect to find in a reputable downtown hotel, were at a higher level at this Condo. Kitchen has everything you need to make a lovely meal. Lots of ice in the freezer too!<br/>Host was an absolute pleasure. I would recommend this Airbnb to anyone. We are already planning on when we can come back."
26737843,296406563,,27236922,Luis,Perfect location. Quiet place and nice clean apartment. Would stay here next time I am in Seattle. If you are at a conference. It’s a 5 minute walk to conference center.
35649793,484880400,,272491256,Michael,Wonderful people and a very clean and spacious BnB would definitely stay here again. Lots of counter space in the kitchen as well as a Keurig coffee maker. Also has ethernet connection in the bed room.
36202177,645335449,,273481105,Adam,Clean and quiet. They accept pets but charge. Good if you’re in a bind.
49518078,770210769,,273785918,Ellery,"Josh and Kimberly’s basement unit was everything I hoped for. They are caring and responsive hosts. It is a beautiful unit, clean, and close to amazing places. Whenever I thought “I need this…” it was there. I would definitely stay here again."
49290022,754371147,,2741436,Hannah,"Great location! We didn't have to drive our car all weekend. The place was as described, very comfortable bed and awesome shower. We would stay again if in the Ballard area."
43770916,635768894,,27437515,Richelle,Superior to a hotel! Feels like home but better. Shawna made it perfect. Easy commute to all over the Seattle area.
19843399,180956703,,27446837,Robynn,"Naomi's Patio Garden Guesthouse was nothing short of wonderful. My daughter and I spent eleven nights in this delightful and beautifully designed space. Not only did we spend many great nights at Naomi's but we're currently on our fourth consecutive Airbnb for the summer so I feel I'm a decent judge at the moment. <br/>The guesthouse is aesthetically pleasing in every way. The photos are very accurate and show the place well. Don't miss the green roof. It's not a huge space if that's what you're after. It's cozy, comfortable, clean, has distant views from the bedroom, and a view of a beautiful backyard from the rest of the space. Naomi and her family are laid back and welcoming. They are very comfortable either talking to you about the the area, giving helpful information or letting you be if you want privacy. I enjoyed their company very much and my daughter especially enjoyed Sugi the family dog. Sugi is very friendly and pretty much only visits if you want her to. <br/>If you're a walker you will not be disappointed in the number of places you can walk to at any time of day. The neighborhood is quiet and safe. If you don't want to walk, the drives to restaurants and activities are very short and parking was always easy. Naomi and her husband have created a gorgeous garden in the front yard and she offered to let me pick some fresh green beans, cucumber, eggplant, and some herbs to cook with. <br/>Things to note if you don't care as much as we do about architecturally beautiful spaces is that the bathroom sink is cool, but small for someone who needs tons of space. Everything you need is there though and in perfect working order. The fridge is not full size if that matters but you will be delighted by the quality of the appliances. There are lots of windows upstairs and if you don't like to wake up to a bright cheerful morning I bet Naomi will provide eye masks for you as she did for us. There's more than I'm mentioning so you'll just have to see for yourself. Oh, and there's even a parking space for you. What more could one ask for?<br/>Our stay was perfect in every way and this is coming from a woman who is pretty darn picky! We hope you enjoy yourselves as much as we did. I will definitely be going back anytime I can."
6248083,38558742,,27542682,Mike,This is a fantastic property in a great location. I wish I wasn't travelling for work so that I could have spent more time in the house! I really enjoyed exploring the restaurants in the Queen Anne neighborhood.
14213134,125765340,,27571841,Josh,"Mardy's place was the perfect home for 3 months. I am a travel nurse and am traveling with my wife and our 1 year old little girl. The place was furnished with everything imaginable, and very cozy/comfortable. The neighborhood is second to none (a block and a half from the beach, a few blocks from Schmitz preserve park with some awesome hiking trails, and a great playground and community center 2 blocks away). As a host Mardy and Kate went above and beyond, always very responsive and making sure we had everything set up in way that would make it feel like home to us. I would highly recommend this to anyone coming to the area, can't say enough good things about this place and the people renting it."
41778027,6.48E+17,,275773031,Amy,We really enjoyed our stay! The location is in a great neighborhood and the house was clean with everything you need. There was plenty of room for our family and it was nice to not to have to worry about parking or safety. Thank you!
36471906,488232723,,275800843,Kaylene,"I loved the courtyard and the plants! Ballard is a great place to walk around and explore and this place is very convenient and comfortable for walking to the Locks, Park, shopping and dining."
43861016,704487968,,276100032,Noah,"Carly and Brian have created such a beautiful space and our stay was incredible! Everything was spotless, and you could tell they put a lot of thought into making your stay an unforgettable experience. I would highly recommend staying here :)"
36607801,491825136,,276282807,Heather,"This house was an amazing stay for our family/extended family! It had everything we could possibly need and so much more! The space was designed beautifully and was incredibly clean and spacious. It truly felt like a home away from home, and the hosts were so kind and gracious and made themselves available if we ever needed anything. The views of the lake and city were amazing, especially at night, and the abundance of windows with tons of natural light added to the comfort and beauty of the home. The outdoor space was nice as well, complete with a bbq and nice large patio and beautiful little yard that our kids enjoyed spending time in. We will definitely look into staying here again in the future!"
37267631,516732183,,276419882,??,"very large rooms, very good location. But the apartment is just along a road, could be a little noisy."
26425407,6.73E+17,,276573876,Xinxuan,"Super nice experience, the host is friendly, thoughtful and helpful, the house is so clean, comfy and safe with great location. Looking forward to staying here again!"
46260434,717684243,,27660686,Pierce,A nice place to stay! Will definitely recommend to friends!
17787304,146407177,,27661471,Vrushali,Safe residential area but very close from downtown. Bob and Ting's home is beautiful and the room is cozy and comfortable. They are welcoming and great hosts!
48648691,754815059,,27674906,Mindy,My friends and I had a wonderful stay in this beautiful new townhouse. It was so clean and comfortable. The views of Seattle from the rooftop deck are amazing and the neighborhood is in a very nice area. <br/>Sarah was such a kind and responsive host. We accidentally got ourselves locked out and set off the alarm and she was so easy to reach and helped us out immediately. Would definitely stay here again!
49079534,765116594,,277837312,Sofia,"Beautiful, comfy with lots of natural light. If you’re looking to explore Seattle, this is the perfect spot for you. Vivian was an amazing host and was incredibly fast to respond to questions and were even nicer in person. We’ll definitely be back soon!"
7.72E+17,7.99E+17,,277957851,Ethan,"The place was great for the price and the location was okay. Quiet and peaceful area, there was a bus stop in front of the house which made it very convenient. We really enjoyed our stay and everything that was provided, would book the room again!"
18228390,156252898,,27809147,Sue,"What an amazing home in a fantastic location! We were able to get into Seattle easily and yet we were away from the hustle and bustle of a big city. A beautiful home in a quiet neighbourhood, we enjoyed walking to the lake and stopping for a snack at the little restaurant nearby. Late in the day it was a pleasure to sit in the back yard and enjoy the lovely ambience of this special neighbourhood. A real gem and a perfect spot to stay while enjoying all that Seattle has to offer."
35843937,497706158,,278396646,Anapatricia,"Great hosts and good communication! Only thing is it a bit hard to locate. Very good for privacy but it did seem like more of the basement of the home than a studio. Other than that, good place!"
45218253,666865445,,27846977,Niko,Li gave the best service I've ever had from an Airbnb host. We accidentally locked ourselves out at 1am on Saturday night and she drove out personally to help us get in. Incredible!
20367435,196322775,,27870939,Yani,The apt is very close to UW
34779314,3.93E+17,,278890848,Mindy,Great house. Super updated and clean! The house manager was very nice and responsive. The view was amazing- we live watching the sunsets. Great find.
7035498,39890160,,2795861,Gabriel,"The place is flawless. Super convenient and close to tons of interesting parts of Seattle. I would definitely recommend it, my one reservation was that there was a management company handling the property which required a complicated agreement in addition to airbnb and dealing with them was a bit impersonal. I understand I was the first stay so maybe they will be able to work that out."
9368342,74287155,,28019575,Kadi,"Manomi's home was absolutely perfect for our stay in Seattle. Since she had no reviews, I reached out to her before requesting to book this home. From the initial interaction, I knew she was the host for us. Manomi is extremely generous with her suggestions and information about her home/neighborhood/city. This was our first time to Seattle, so we could not have appreciated her more. (She left us a binder full of information at her house as well.) <br/><br/>Her home is spacious and well-kept. It's modern, yet cozy and very, very clean. The pictures are accurate. <br/><br/>The neighborhood is stunning. I would never stay anywhere else in the city. I could not get over how beautiful everything was: the houses, the flowers, the view. (I should note, the sun was shining during the entire trip.) We walked to Kerry Park multiple times because the walk and view are incredible. The location is ideal for first-time visitors who like peace and quiet, yet easy access to cafes, restaurants, shops, and bars. <br/><br/>I have nothing but positive things to say about our stay at Manomi's home. We will definitely stay here if we make our way to Seattle again!"
45870457,5.36E+17,,280257195,Luis,Great place at a fantastic location!
39300764,569161359,,280416817,Paula,"Quaint is perfect, immaculate, many thoughtful additions. Host replied quickly was friendly, clear, helpful and was accommodating even though my travel times changed."
5680462,35080728,,28059511,Gay,"We loved the location and the spaciousness of the house. We had an extended family of ten, including two children under age five. With only two showers there were times we waited in line. The nearby bus stop/line served us well for getting downtown. A few in our group had bicycles and were able to ride all over Seattle - the best way to travel. We enjoyed several of the nearby restaurants - easily within walking distance - and the nearby market was very convenient. The playroom upstairs is a paradise for children of all ages. The youngsters also enjoyed the backyard swingset. Sarah and Daniel were very attentive and helpful."
47820761,729281541,,281364411,Deborah,"Trust this listing’s photos! This was a lovely home with every amenity you could ask for. And the location is phenomenal — it felt like we were close to everything. Would definitely recommend, and would stay again the next time we’re in Seattle."

3921664,57692093,,28253844,Corey,"Big thumbs up for this place, Ariel is a great host, apartment is as described in a great location close to the city centre. One of the best air BnB apartments we have stayed in, and wouldn't hesitate rebooking if we were back in Seattle."
36450142,510912866,,282974814,Richard,M is a great host and the place is perfect for a couple or single traveler.
16353693,124395512,,28301506,Chris,"Siena was very friendly and helpful throughout our stay, and always responded quickly to our messages. The apartment was spotless and very well furnished, and while not huge it was big enough for the four of us. The location was close enough to walk to the places we wanted to see and the view from the apartment was pretty nice. The only real issue was the heating would switch on early in the morning, and the banging of the pipes are enough to wake you up if you're a light sleeper. It only lasts a few minutes though."
16519633,652344522,,283092007,Ramon,Beautiful home. About 10 min drive to ride Ferry to other town across the waters. Neighborhood is super friendly.

30228341,513661551,,283859530,Daniel,"This place was beyond amazing. My friends and I were very excited to visit Seattle and staying here was the best decision we made. The location is very convenient and close to many great places to eat and the city, not to mention how beautiful the venue was. Alice, the host, was very welcoming and was easy to get in touch with. My friends and I certainly plan on staying here again on our next Seattle trip."
24580635,266906329,,28400196,Amy Jane,"Regina and Bo's place is such a gem. We're actually lucky enough to have a few weeks here and we love it! They are super responsive hosts and you can't beat the view from this mid century modern two bedroom. We have everything we need and the only thing I'd mention is that in the summer it can be a little loud, but it's summertime on Alki, that's to be expected. Bring earplugs and get ready to enjoy that view! We're locals and we plan to be back, for sure."
564428,1735283,,2842978,Britt,"Superb neighborhood to walk around--lake Washington a short distance and the light rail to SeaTac and downtown only a few blocks. Comfy house and, Oh, did I say the hostess is terrific."
708774,3082551,,2846307,Richard,"As advertised, a clean very central apartment with all the amenities provided. A bargain at the price. Quiet, comfortable with good and easy parking. All instructions were clear and the building was everything advertised and more. I would stay here again without hesitation."
4973204,27741020,,28479167,Kelly,"Best accommodations ever! This property delivered all it promised and more! Amazing location, QUIET neighborhood, but a short walk to trendy restaurants and the Space Needle. Our hosts thought of everything, the house was squeaky clean, beautifully decorated, and very comfortable. Our host was always a quick text message away, he responded within 10 minutes to any of our inquiries, and checked in daily to see if we were comfortable or needed anything. We're extremely happy with our accommodations in Seattle."
1737244,28220337,,28479565,Michael,"I had a great time staying with Constance. She's very friendly, thoughtful and overall made me feel very welcome in her home. The room was quiet, comfortable and just as described in her ad. The location is great, and I have no reservations recommending to stay here. I would stay here again."
16962405,144901155,,28515996,Nathan,"We loved staying at this clean and conveniently located Queen Anne neighborhood home with spectacular views of Puget Sound and Olympic mountains. <br/>Very clean and as pictured. The home is very open, spacious, quiet, and gets great natural light. Lots of seating around bay windows to enjoy the gorgeous views. It's fun to watch the barges and ferries going to and fro. Kitchen is well-stocked and beds are super comfy. The pool table and foosball are fun to play at night. There are also some games and books which offer a homey touch. <br/>Great central location to explore Seattle and surrounding areas in the beautiful Queen Anne neighborhood. 10 minute walk to Kerry Park which offers some of the best views of Seattle. Plenty of restaurants and coffee shops nearby. <br/>Cathy was a wonderful host. She was quick to respond on AirBnB and answered all of our questions. She greeted us on arrival and showed us around her place so we felt comfortable where everything was. She even left us some fresh fruit and wine on arrival and made sure the pantry and fridge were stocked with some basic essentials. During the stay, she checked in to make sure everything was going smoothly and get us anything we needed.<br/>Overall, we would highly recommend this AirBnB!<br/>"
37354182,510940106,,285406421,Juni,We had a good time.

25296669,270624285,,28586798,Jaime,Sean & Barbara were super sweet and accommodating. The place was very cozy and quaint and just a short drive from downtown Seattle.
48041277,733432566,,285887340,Kanika,"Sherry’s place is so charming! We loved our time in Seattle, mostly because of how comfortable we were waking up and working from this space. Sherry is so thoughtful and responsive, and we’ll surely be staying here again the next time we visit!"
18636268,164314506,,28595666,David And Teresa,Overall a good value. I think this was a new rental and there were a few kinks to work out but Shawn was a good host and I'm sure will fix those. It was indeed well stocked with food etc. It did sleep six although one of the bedrooms is a space off of the living room divided with a curtain. It's a good location for seeing Seattle's downtown. Close to public transportation. We enjoyed our stay.
28497431,8.87E+17,,28653697,Barbara,"One of our best Airbnb stays ever! Wonderful hosts, lovely accommodations, spotlessly clean. Loved!"
53786724,6.22E+17,,28686327,Alyssa,"I feel incredibly lucky to have met and stayed in Kathleen’s studio. As a first time solo, female traveler, I was a bit nervous about what I’d be stepping into. Thank heavens my entire stay was such a pleasant experience. Firstly, Kathleen is an outstanding host. She is easy to communicate with and very conscious of your comfort and needs. She respects your privacy and will keep you in the loop via text on any updates with the house. The space is just as pictured: very clean, comfortable, and nicely decorated. The kitchenette came equipped with all the essentials and had plenty of cabinet space. Large fridge and freezer to store your groceries. Kitchen table also made for a good work station. The bathroom was spacious and clean. There is plenty of shelving and an armoire to store your belongings. The king bed was one of the most comfortable Airbnb beds I’ve slept on. It’s dangerously inviting- you’ll never want to leave! Washer and dryer is located conveniently outside of the back entrance door. You can easily check to see if other tenants are using the machine and time when you use it accordingly. You get one assigned parking spot at the back of the house, but there’s always extra parking out front if needed. Conveniently located to many grocers, restaurants, parks, and freeways. I felt very safe walking around this district. If you’re a travel nurse and plan to work at Children’s Hospital, the purple shuttle line is just a mile away. Also learned that the Roosevelt Sound Transit station is just a few blocks down. It’s an inexpensive way to get to and from the airport and all over Seattle. Kathleen’s house is truly a hidden gem. I highly recommend it!"
43458820,638220191,,287173727,Aaron,A-team and Marcus were AWESOME hosts they communicated quickly and clearly every time I had questions. The condo is set up perfectly it has EVERYTHING you could need and is in an awesome location for walking around downtown and exploring. I felt like the building was very quite and I never heard neighbors or noise. I recommend staying here for however long you are in Seattle it is a very awesome place!
5407311,28682565,,28876076,Dwight,Melissa made check in easy and was a fine host. The apartment is comfortable and as advertised and the neighborhood is great. We would not hesitate to rent it again.
8869680,51406363,,28880440,JingJing,Basic but comfortable studio. Sheldon was very flexible and allowed a later checkout. Awesome location

39467892,571052989,,29063219,Megan,Beautiful home and amazing hosts! We spent Thanksgiving here and Lynne was so accommodating and kind. The home is big and spacious and my kids loved the fenced-in play area out back. <br/>The driveway is a little narrow and you have to back out to the street and we found parking on the road to the side of the house to be the better option. <br/>We are already planning to stay here again!
18529198,160135019,,2909299,Kathleen,"Lisa's place is very charming and eclectic with lots of unusual furnishings and pieces of art. Lisa was very welcoming, letting us know the quirky ins and outs of this unusual property....like the locations of the light switches. There was a lot of space for our small group and a beautiful outdoor space that we wished we had more time to enjoy. One thing to note is that there is not a microwave, for those who need something to heat up your leftovers."
38577704,534559798,,291873553,Logan,"Kinda small if you're over 6 ft but very cute and homely. Good amenities, shared bathroom so take note of that."

12537842,93804474,,29224175,Michelle,Appreciate the great stay. The location was perfect... Walking distance to all that is great about living on QA. The directions were complete. We enjoyed feeding the chickens and gathering eggs each day. Perfect for our family of four.

53828562,5.61E+17,,292519,Eric,Kathleen's place is really a great place to stay. It is less than a 10-minute walk to the nearby light rail station. The suite comes with a very comfortable king size bed with high quality bedding. I've been using the large dining table as my temporary home office desk. All of the basic kitchen necessities are included. There is also one reserved off-street parking space on the back side. The washing machine and dryer are also brand new and work very well. Kathleen has been very fast to respond to messages and is doing an excellent job as an Airbnb host.
5.82E+17,5.89E+17,,292649909,Flavius,"nice place, very close to downtown. clean and spacious"
3441487,40893421,,29275232,Haley,"David's apartment is a great place to stay. I stayed for three months and thoroughly enjoyed my stay. David is a friendly and attentive host, and ensured that any concerns of ours were addressed.<br/>The apartment comfortably houses two. There is a nice couch and television for relaxing. The dining space is somewhat small, but we found it to be a great size for two. The apartment was clean, spacious, and situated in a good part of town. It is next to Seattle University, so nights can be a bit noisy, but this is to be expected in a city. The temperature was fine throughout the summer, even with heat waves; there is a large sliding door to let in a breeze when it warms up.<br/>All in all, a wonderful place to stay in Seattle! Would highly recommend."
33395033,527397295,,293122982,Shayla,"I had a lovely stay at the guesthouse, which is super stylish yet comfortable, and very well-appointed. Linens & mattresses were top notch. Loved the reading/nap nook! And the abstract art & ceramics from local artists. Neighborhood was quirky & cool and it's a quick walk to shopping & the light rail. The whole experience was a delight, I only wish I could have stayed longer!"
53149013,5.32E+17,,293233691,Lance,"I stayed in Seattle for a few nights to watch a football game. Great location, right beside downtown and close to the stadium. Very happy with the place and location. The house is nice and well maintained. I'm booking thisplace next time I'm in Seattle."

All anemities included, only needed to pack clothing. Host is super accommodating and arranged for me to check in 4 hours earlier with minimal notice. Definitely reccommend this place!"
38328402,534572968,,295508471,Reyna,This place was great! Sean gave us recommendations for dinner. Just a short drive to food and the grocery store. The place was cozy and clean. I'm going to tell my friends to stay here while visiting Seattle. Only a 15 minute drive to Pike Place.
38646737,538367762,,295878175,Katia,Overall it was a pleasant place to stay. Clean and comfortable.
12601662,79879016,,29631485,Meredith,"Leslie is the most wonderful host there is. She made sure to reach out and see if there was anything she could do ahead of time to accommodate our stay. Beyond that, when we arrived, she left cheese & crackers, sparkling cider, sparkling water, and champagne. She gave us great tips for places to go nearby. The home was better than we could have ever imagined. It's perfect described as a cozy artist house. The updates that have been made match the character of this home. Incredible kitchen and bathroom. Both bedrooms very a great size with plenty of storage and comfy beds. The backyard has a hammock and sitting area with a fire pit. It was so wonderful. The area had so many great places near it. It was a quick Uber ride in town ($10). We will most definitely be coming back to stay at this house!"

26014732,302508232,,29653290,Pamela,Fantastic location and very nice accommodations. Kristin is a very friendly and responsive host. Discovery park is literally across the street. The space away from the center of Seattle is worth it!
32879656,7.96E+17,,296818104,Joel,"Booked last minute and Alex was able to make it happen! Can walk to several spots ( Market, Space Needle, etc.) thanks Alex!!"

5470943,33092202,,29825177,Patrick,"Matthew was a great host. He welcomed us fully when my group and I got into town. He answered lots of questions about things to do in the area, and was very willing to get to know us. The neighborhood is delightful, and the apartment is very clean as well as fully furnished. I really couldn't have asked for more."
42401874,616824752,,29860292,Cameron,"Spotlessly clean, everything seemed brand new. Good fast communication. Easy parking on street right outside front door. Run down house nearby but didn't cause any problem. Excellent Vietnamese/Thai restaurant right around the corner. Easy drive to downtown."
2267862,79139508,,2988066,Erez,"Had a very pleasant stay in Shawn's brand new studio. It's like a big tiny home layout. Beds lofted above the kitchen, tons of windows and nice sized living room. Perfect for a place to call home while I was in Seattle for the week. He was nice enough to let me borrow a bike and lock, ideal as there is a great bike trail just down the street."
5749958,31219577,,2991479,Ruth,Our host had wine and flowers waiting for us. We felt very welcome.
47478661,769055007,,299270049,Rene,I had a great time at Jackie’s place. The communication was super easy and quick and the place looks exactly like it does on the pictures. The neighborhood is very conveniently located and the apartment was very quiet! Would absolutely recommend to stay there!<br/>Jackie and her husband are very nice and friendly.
39138621,602757158,,299354491,John,It was a great place to stay. Yoyo was very nice and easy to communicate with. I will definitely come back there to stay again!
53852055,5.94E+17,,299380967,Howard,"Thanks Kira! The apartment has a beautiful view of the space needle and downtown, and is decorated nicely. It is a very spacious place, with lots of amenities and nice touches (water in fridge, extra bathroom and cleaning supplies, etc), and everything was very comfortable. Checking in and out was easy, with clear instructions. This was a perfect location for us (only a few blocks from our daughter), and is great if you are looking for a place in the city."
49654068,3.9E+17,,29955115,Sam,"My friends and I visited Seattle for the very first time and chose this Air BnB because we wanted something outside of downtown. I'm so glad we chose this place. It was very cozy with plenty of spots to lounge. It slept the 3 of us very well, and could definitely fit a couple more adults. We loved all the charming details, such as the clawfoot tub, various maps and art on the walls, and the backyard pagoda. <br/>We unwound every evening in front of the couch, enjoying easy access to Hulu and Netflix. We loved being walking distance to California ave, which is absolutely loaded with bars, restaurants, shops, and bus stops. The mountain views from the sidewalk are incredible. I must also mention, the inclusion of nice soaps and toiletries came in handy since we didn't pack very much. Thanks again!"
22037772,230946277,,29999945,Huy,A++ house. Great location where it’s 15-20 mins from everything. Very spacious home
3121829,16118018,,3005115,Theresa,"We really enjoyed staying in this townhouse in the Ballard neighborhood of Seattle. It's very spacious and in a great location! We could walk to bars, restaurants, parks, the locks and more. It's a very clean house. We had three guests, so one person slept on the couch, which was really comfortable."
49010380,746442851,,30070234,Rudi,Impeccable apartment and service. <br/>The very best AirBnb experience so far. <br/>Location is great for a foodie city break. <br/>Highly recommend!

This location cannot be beat, can walk to pikes market, space needle, tons of amazing coffee shops, restaurants, breakfast spots, cvs, everything you could ever need for an amazing stay in belltown<br/>2. Zach is an absolutely fantastic host, quick responses, checkin was a breeze, and when we made requests he followed up and was nothing but professional and accommodating. <br/>3. Will 100% stay again!"
25055857,270257967,,301107,Perry,"Decided last minute to stay at Giulio's place for the Holiday Weekend. His condo is clean, modern and offers plenty of space to stretch out. The bathroom is huge! It's also perfectly situated for a fun weekend downtown, especially if you want to save on the cost of a rental car. It was $4 and pretty easy to get there by Airport Light Rail. The gym in the building was empty and a great convenience. Giulio met us for check in and offered lots of great personalized advice for restaurants nearby. We especially liked walking along the water to the sculpture garden and then got happy hour at The Edgewater, a beautiful old hotel on the waterfront. The next night we got drinks and dinner in quirky capital hill. It was an easy Uber right to get there. There's a taxi next door at the Marriott Hotel too. His place is so comfortable and there are so many fun neighborhoods nearby to explore that we could have easily stayed a week. Thanks for everything, would definitely stay there again!"
48336213,740109259,,30131045,Susan,We were so relieved to find this place as a very last minute booking when we had a plumbing emergency at our house. Amy's place was neat and tidy and had all the things we needed during our stay. The beds were comfy and we had plenty of space to be able to stretch out. The wifi was great - three of us were able to do meetings and virtual school with zero issues. Amy had fantastic response time to all of our questions and was a great communicator!
44357965,664410310,,301585774,Corderro,"I had a great one month stay at Lynn’s place! The unit was clean, cozy, spacious, and private. I had everything I needed. Lynn was available, hospitable, and checked in with me periodically to ensure my stay was comfortable. :) I would definitely stay here again and recommend her place if you’re looking for a nice place to stay in Seattle!"
36109243,580562984,,301731621,Travis,Amazing hotel with great access to space needle/downtown. The amenities were great and would definitely stay again!
631445,1975387,,3021444,Andrea,"Our stay in Seattle was lovely. Alicia was nice and extremely helpful. The space was great and had everything one might need. All the rooms are spacious and welcoming, an overall nice and comfortable layout. Located in downtown Seattle allowed us to have access to so much. The view was amazing! The only challenge was parking at times (late nights on the weekend). Great spot and great host. Seattle is beautiful, Alicia's space is representative of the same beauty."
49300280,756860078,,30277364,Landry,"I'm so happy to learn about the history of the Panama hotel. Great location for restaurants and city access. Very glad I made it part of my stay in Seattle, come check it out!"
39320169,560154904,,302792934,Luiza,"Eric and Olga are amazing people! I felt very comfortable and safe in their house. The house is cozy, clean and have a great location. I recommend them very much!"
609610,1816640,,3028020,Robin,"Laura and Karlo were amazing hosts. The apartment I rented was clean and warm, with its own entrance, bathroom, a fully loaded kitchen and all the things you would need for a long term stay in Seattle (although I was there for only 3 days). What really made my stay in this B&B so nice was all the little details and the kindnesses of the hosts, from picking me up at the train station (only 5 minutes from their home - but nice when lost in a new city) to guiding me on efficient ways to travel (20 minutes by bus from downtown), free internet, fresh eggs from their own chickens, and even introductions to their friends who happen to be in my same industry. Overall I had a lovely stay and would return in a heartbeat."
41262912,603919960,,302910012,Doug,Ivan is an incredibly kind host who really goes out of his way to make you feel at home. It really felt like I was staying at a friends place.
10364350,61013253,,30301304,Baljit,Susan is an amazing and gracious hostess and made us feel comfortable throughout our stay. I'm looking forward to staying with her again on our next visit to Seattle.
13787761,83849048,,30307721,Marques,"Janet's upstairs apartment far exceeded our expectations. There was plenty of space, and my wife and I felt very comfortable staying there for 2 days. The house was decorated with so many unique vintage details and antiques. It felt like an artist's cove with Janet's art studio set up as the sitting room, lined with paintings and artwork. The hard floors and lovely wall colors paired nicely with the rugs and furniture. The kitchen was well appointed and we enjoyed breakfast there in the mornings. The photos & description on the listing were accurate, and the space was clean and even lovelier than we anticipated!<br/><br/>The apartment was decked out with all the amenities we needed: shampoo, towels, extra blankets, tea, coffee, milk, apples, cooking supplies. The bed was cozy and the apartment was rather quiet. We both slept easily and soundly. Speedy WiFi connection. The neighborhood is residential and we felt very safe in our surroundings. The house and front garden are so cute, and the space was so beautiful and charming. I felt more comfortable in this Airbnb than any other my wife and I have stayed it (a total of 6 so far). <br/><br/>Janet was quite prompt in her communication with us. She made us feel welcome immediately with a tour of the house, back garden, and upstairs apartment with a separate entrance. She was very kind and friendly to us, giving us city and neighborhood recommendations, and explaining the bus stop 1.5 block away. Janet made freshly baked cookies for us, and even accommodated my wife's dietary restrictions (gluten-free, limited sugar) with blueberry/yam almond flour muffins, which was such a thoughtful touch! We will certainly stay here at the apartment next time we're in Seattle. Thanks, Janet!"
39724418,626342404,,303155725,Hasan,Great place to stay!
6.87E+17,7.28E+17,,303263753,Gabriella,The location was outstanding! We could not have had a better view for our first time in Seattle. The host was great and the place was nice and big.
49800206,764419500,,303540668,Noah,"Great little place to stay for the weekend, very close to pioneer square. Jan was very sweet and always checked in on us when we were leaving the hotel. Very easy to talk to."
28051388,324339362,,30381870,Daniel,"The location was a little weird (the doorway opened into an alley), but the unit is right next to a great neighborhood in the heart of Seattle."
37972938,4.91E+17,,304189296,Phillip,"Great location for those looking to explore Seattle.<br/>Property is close to the Space Needle, Market Square and other similar points of interest.<br/>The property is clean and the views are wonderful."
45641533,701882560,,304369482,John,Viraj's place is perfect for 1 or 2 people! Great location and very cozy. The patio was a plus too. Definitely reccomend.
5883409,30473385,,30493066,Julieann,The provider was extremely helpful and filled our apartment with supplies. She even gave us a laundry basket and clothes hangars to use. The furniture was also cute decorative furniture. A super great stay
13925303,87507727,,30541208,Andrew,"Randy met us outside when we arrived. He was very friendly and casual, great host and conversation partner from what we gathered. The room was a lot of bang for your buck, while a bit small, everything from tea and water to a mini-fridge was provided in the room itself. It was really an incredible amount of privacy tucked into the much larger house. Would definitely recommend!"
44360168,652922505,,30551843,Darren,"My wife and I stayed in Vince and Ann's townhouse for 10 nights while visiting family I'm the Seattle area. It is a fantastic place - very clean, comfortable, and quiet. The kitchen is well equipped for cooking. The bed was comfortable and the AC came in handy during the heat wave that took place while we were there. The rooftop was great for enjoying an early morning coffee or watching the sunset. Great location as well - walking distance to grocery stores, restaurants and breweries. Didn't have any issues with street parking and always found a spot easily. Will definitely stay again when back in the area! "
4752817,24695232,,305546,Adam,"Great experience! Listing was accurate and we felt totally accommodated on our trip.<br/><br/>Highly recommended!"
36491125,528216453,,30681680,Gulsheen,"D and J’s place is conveniently located to downtown, SLU and capitol hill areas so it made it really easy for me to walk everywhere. They have put many thoughtful touches to the place that makes your stay comfortable. They were very responsive throughout the stay and made me feel welcomed. Would love to stay again with them again."
45162763,730621825,,307057139,Jonathan,"The house was clean and neat, a little cluttered but overall good house. <br/>Note, they do have a caretaker that lives in the bottom section of the house which is not listed in the description. <br/>He also has the code to get into the house when ever he pleases. <br/>He’s walked in on us for a noise complaint. Would’ve preferred a message from the host instead of him walking in and the storming out leaving the door open."
39950187,565774117,,307065529,Rebekah,Fantastic place with a great eco-friendly breakfast free of paper goods and disposable utensils. Cute window seats in some rooms. Not for individuals who struggle with stairs or sharing a clean bath and shower room with all guests on the floor.
564220,1996782,,3072057,Lisa,"Kristin was a superb host, so friendly and informative and answered our endless questions. She went the extra mile looking after us. Kristin is a joy to stay with warm and friendly and made us feel at home for our first trip to the US. The house is well located to the public transport system and Seattle is a great city to vacation in."
7353834,42009289,,30736125,Blake,"Melissa's apartment was located in a very walkable location next to the University of Washington. <br/><br/>She made check-in and check-out very smooth and simple.<br/><br/>The listing is accurate and I would be happy to return in the future."
23699409,285462012,,30739794,Jason,Lynne was quick to respond. The rental home accommodated our large group of 7 with ease. She added small touches to make you welcome. Thanks.
14522498,95965833,,30742422,Keith,"Jonathan was great and had everything in tip top shape for our arrival. The basement unit is beautiful, incredibly clean and also just a nice relaxing environment. The Quenn Anne location is perfect for morning walks and just a beautiful area. I would recommend this to everyone and cannot say enough good things about our stay here."
1807936,152037595,,30750591,Neha,"This is a very unique space in a beautiful neighborhood. Ev is very easy going, easy to communicate with, and easy to get ahold of. The instruments and the furnishings are a nice change from the average pre-fab spaces of other airbnbs in Seattle. Organic surroundings, a very homey feel, and solid amenities round out a very calm, and low key environment. It's especially great to support a local business/space for learning music. I would definitely stay again!"
50993665,5.49E+17,,307630995,Doumy,"Dylan's place was the cleanest stay I've ever seen! It is by far the BEST stay I've ever booked because of the value, cleanliness, location, and not to mention the friendliness of the host. My wife and I really enjoyed the modern kitchen, hardwood floors, and the view of the community garden. What really made this stay shine was the following:<br/>- Keurig machine<br/>- Labeled cabinets in the kitchen<br/>- TV with Netflix, Amazon Video, and Hulu subscription<br/>- Climate controls throughout the house<br/>- Modern washer and dryer <br/>- Modern kitchen appliances <br/>- A work desk in the bedroom<br/>Don't hesitate to book this stay, YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!"
41602651,613402379,,308199036,Iris,Lee is the best host ever ! The place is wonderful and everything we need is prepared and clean.

49832497,3.94E+17,,30861701,James,"Great location, nice clean place, and good hosts. Kenny & James also provided a good guide to the neighborhood which included restaurant and sightseeing suggestions, and more. I was very pleased and comfortable and had a good time."
6.95E+17,7.24E+17,,30885659,Sally,"This was probably the best Airbnb we’ve ever booked. It was super clean and comfy, stylish and so well appointed, including generous snacks and toiletries, fluffy towels, quality linens. Marshall and Kevin were very personable, responsive hosts. The location was great - quiet neighborhood, sweet back yard, off street parking. Check in was super smooth. Everything was perfect and we would definitely book this again!"
26364712,288383205,,30940158,Carlos,Melody’s place is amazing. An Uber to downtown is affordable and probably 10-15 minutes only. Public transportation is walkable distance as well if you prefer it. The neighborhood is quiet but no secluded. The place itself is nice and has a very relaxing patio. It was clean and just as shown in the pictures. Melody is very caring and communicates back and forth very quickly. Hospitality was great. I’ll try to stay back here when I’m in town again.
51738969,5.88E+17,,3096120,Robyn,"The apartment was clean, modern, and very accurately described in its description. The staff was quick to reply to any questions or concerns I had. I would definitely stay here again and recommend it as great home away from home in Seattle."
16516756,145542414,,30973619,Brittany,We loved staying at Melissa's home and it was extremely convenient for us visiting family down the street. Ballard is a beautiful area and we enjoyed staying at Melissa's quiet and kid friendly home.
50311980,770217476,,309741733,Agustina,"My stay in this property was AMAZING! The unit was extremely clean and the hosts communicate everything you need to know before your arrival, they even created an online guidebook with all the information which was very useful. What I loved the most was how complete the unit was, it felt like home. The kitchen has all you need, even a drawer with spices of all kinds. The unit comes with a Nespresso machine which was awesome and they also provide capsules of all kinds!! Location couldn't be more perfect, close to everywhere. I will definitely book again and highly recommend this space for other guests!"
5682316,31002169,,30979394,Orlina,"Elyse and her husband were extremely welcoming and communicative in ensuring all our needs were met. The location of the space was very convenient for us as our family resides in the Columbia City/Rainier Valley. Light rail access was a hop, skip and a jump which allowed us to hit Pike Place Market for a hot minute and jump back to the southside with the quickness. The space was pristine clean to the max and stocked with the essentials which allowed us to cook our meals through the week. We never had to ask for anything during our stay. No Pets which is helpful for us because of our allergies to pet dander. Privacy gets Five Stars too. Next time we’re in town, we hope to stay with Elyse. As we would expect with this amazing guesthouse, they’re already booked during our next weekend in town so we’ll have to book early."
49044118,9.85E+17,,310481406,Wayne,"Wen is a very friendly host. The house is very nice to live, everything is clean and surrounding is very quiet and peaceful. There are many great restaurants around as well. Very good experience!"

34907038,633149717,,3106618,Danielle,"Bryan was an exceptional host! I was passing through Seattle en route to visit family during the COVID-19 pandemic and was very reluctant to book anywhere to stay. I reached out to Bryan beforehand with a laundry list of questions. He responded immediately with thorough, thoughtful responses about the precautions he was taking, and I was completely reassured. The house was sparkling clean when I arrived and beautifully decorated! With all the plants in a renovated mid-century modern home, it was like staying at a Palm Springs resort! The weather was great, so we decided to use the barbecue grill and ate out on the patio in the garden. The beds were so comfortable. I slept like a baby! The whole experience was an incredible, refreshing relief from a stressful road trip. If I am ever in Seattle again, I will be sure to stay at Bryan‘s house and highly recommend you do the same!"
39799129,581378612,,311028946,George,Stay at Maia place it was more then what we expected it was real nice

32967408,455556405,,31216005,Corey,"This place is incredibly spacious, clean, accommodating, and enjoyable. VERY worth it for the price. Plenty of sleeping space, comfortable beds and couch, as well as great linens. The smart TV is a great touch. We also loved the decor. Hosts went above and beyond to provide local tips, parking instructions, games, free WiFi, etc. would absolutely rent again."
28385302,345342628,,31220588,Maia,"The little house on the corner was such a relaxing getaway! This space is BEAUTIFULLY built with amenities that you rarely find in a tiny house. Gordon was an excellent communicator and made sure the whole process was smooth. <br/>Also note: we rarely left Greenwood (except to go to the spa) and all of our needs were met! There’s a delicious taco joint around the corner, and a yummy organic cafe 5 minutes away. Did I mention the 20 minute walk to the water?! <br/>This place is perfect for any occasion. A quick trip, or a several night stay. Definitely will come back."
6214517,35221766,,31248080,Osazonamen,"Dennis was easy reached and helpful. The view was just as described and wonderful. My family and I were the first occupants in this newly remodeled unit and it seemed as though the remodel was a bit rushed because there were a few issues. Although Dennis fully disclosed these issues, they were somewhat distracting and inconvenient."
46993410,735411259,,313428482,Xochitl,Great service. Perfect location.
45736425,9.34E+17,,313598784,Carmen Gabriela,"Such an awesome Airbnb! Very clean, spacious, homey and the host was super sweet and helpful.

49800201,768163633,,3142442,Ben,"Great, very old historic hotel. Wonderful hospitality from Jan. Love the tea café/museum next door. I hope this building remains and is never bulldozed over to make way for a condo or anything. Now, that being said, the bed could have used an update. It was very old-fashioned, spring, and wasn't too comfortable to lie on. The hotel was pretty empty when I was there, so it was very easy to use the shared toilet/shower down the hall. The room had charming antique furniture, lighting fixture. Good bedding. Front door access requires a knock/phone call (no key), which isn't too convenient but is important for security purposes. Will like to stay here again."
620518,1987817,,3142467,Xiaoxiang,"Very nice studio, the room is bright and clean, with tables plenty convenient. There is refrigerator, you can cook some easy food,<br/>and the bath room is so big and good for you to use by yourself.<br/>There are wash machine in the first floor, you can help everything all by yourself. <br/><br/>It is on the 65th, the traffic is quite convienient, several bus stops nearby within walking distance.<br/><br/>The host is kind and friendly too, Sure I would like to stay one more time when I have opportunity to come again."
40162643,573651223,,314501500,Jason,Great value. Great location. Clean. Host left good instructions and was helpful.
4364624,74950625,,31535323,Christopher,"Amazing place, David had everything a person could need. The fridge and kitchen was well stocked (I've stayed at shared/private room listings that had less in their fridge) and the fridge had an ice machine, great for when you're taking day trips out into the wild and need ice for a lunchbox or cooler.<br/>The space was big enough for 4 adults and beds and comforters were very comfortable. <br/>The bathroom was stocked with spa quality soaps and shampoo. David also provided a detailed guide about things in the area. <br/>I particularly liked the place because it had its own parking spot right next to the cottage, and the fact that we were detached from the main house. <br/>The location is great! Very close to everything, capital hill bars and restaurants can be walked to or you can get an uber/lyft for under $10 to them.<br/>Also for people on a budget this place is great because you can take advantage of such a great kitchen and make your own meals. Trader Joe's is less than 10 minutes away as well as many other great grocery stores. <br/>I would personally recommend this place and stay there again."
948077,3954322,,3157082,Courtney,"This cottage is an absolute GEM! We had a fabulous time staying here. The space is cozy and every detail is attended to (menus to local restaurants, recommendations, etc.) We especially enjoyed the luxurious heated towel rack and heated mattress pad. Capitol Hill is a great neighborhood to stay in, and this cottage is extremely well situated. It is close to many restaurants and sights, and has the added bonus of being in a beautiful, quiet neighborhood. I would absolutely recommend this place to anyone looking to stay in Seattle!"
48801924,770174273,,316624197,Sarah,Place is well maintained . It’s small but it is perfect if you are traveling alone or with one other person.
8373832,63764756,,31679134,Megan,"Marian's home is beautiful and even better than in the photos! The view, the decor - it's like being on vacation even if you are from Seattle and just looking for a weekend retreat. It was wonderful working with her and she made the whole process a breeze! I highly recommend this home!!!"
6.98E+17,7.75E+17,,31689037,Alan,"Terrific location, design, and value. There were a few annoying “bugs” but the owner was very responsive and is committed to fixing them."
51905212,6.38E+17,,31693549,Susan,"Zane’s place was really nice, loved the beautiful garden and special touches in the house. Fully equipped kitchen and it was walking distance to UW. Great location and it was even close to a lovely park to walk/ run in where it didn’t even seem like you were in the middle of a big city!"
9.24E+17,9.5E+17,,317084722,Paul,"Isaiah is a great and very responsive host. The place is nice, located in a quiet area and with a convenient small front porch."
40805123,632343387,,318448543,Brian,"I stayed in the place for 6 months. Originally it was a month, but kept extending because it was so great. Only reason I left was that it was rented and not available for the next month. Accurate description, emasculate place, great location. Host was helpful and responsive."
7638282,41174386,,31875723,Pamela,"This is a retreat in a true sense of the word. Manghild was a welcoming host who provided not only a beautiful space, but a relaxing one. I wished there wasn't so much to do and see in Seattle because I would have loved to be in the living room and just put my feet up and observe the passing clouds in the skylights. It was quiet in the neighborhood, close to the bus line and I was lucky to be her first guest."
48826380,743372790,,318773490,Quân,Place looks much better than expected based on the photoz
1417880,6017336,,3192103,Nick And Payel,Great simple place. Very nice host.
48198505,737355294,,31922095,Ronia,"We couldn't have found a better place to stay for our 3 days in Seattle. The location was incredible, so many cool areas to explore nearby and only a short drive away from the downtown area. The actual place itself was so cozy and comfortable. Everything was new and sparklingly clean. No TV so it's a great place to be for quality time! The washer, dryer, and laundry detergent was a much appreciated addition. Allan was very friendly and easy to reach. We would definitely stay here again."
47942972,732694323,,319456622,T V S,Great place with all the required amenities and the hosts are very friendly.
19855651,184473305,,31948086,Melissa,"Nice, comfortable, clean (most of the furnishings seemed brand new), private place to stay in a cute, quiet neighborhood. Scott was super helpful and provided us with lots of information for getting around beforehand. Short 5 min walk to the bus stop with a bus that takes you directly downtown. Check in/check out was easy peasy. Overall, we had a very pleasant experience, would definitely recommend!"
36201756,634105832,,319782174,Joy,They were really nice! Showed hospitality
24015983,257321930,,31998420,Chris,Nick’s space was fantastic! He was an incredibly responsive and attentive host and his knowledge of the city is top notch. I couldn’t have asked for a better stay in Seattle.
15407769,139500059,,32012893,Tess,One of the best Air BandB's I have stayed in. Could walk to the beach with beautiful mountain views and in a great neighborhood with an awesome mix of architecture. The apartment was exactly what I needed for a week long conference and some sightseeing. Was 20 minutes to the ferry and 20 minutes to downtown. It was the best of both worlds. Laura was a great host with a beautiful place. I hope to be able to return again!
7434103,39864276,,32019829,Whitney,"This was a charming home, and Heather was an easy host. Her description is spot on. It is truly a mid-twentieth-century home, as represented, fixtures dated, but overall immaculate. It is even more charming than the pictures, serene, with many personal touches. I walked in the neighborhood, very pleasant, with a long stairway down to the trail that borders Lake Washington. Bed was very comfortable. The room is around the corner of the house from her sleeping quarters, so while you are sharing a home, it is pretty private. <br/><br/>Heather left a lovely breakfast of homemade yogurt and granola and coffee/tea/fruit and other choices. Nice departure from the sterility of a hotel. Thank you, Heather!"
41976609,7.12E+17,,32133653,Caio,"The location is great and the apartment itself was clean and well stocked with kitchen utensils, towels, etc. Overall a great spot! Only reason I put 4 stars is because there is no A/C in the unit and the sun hits the windows directly in the afternoon, turning the apartment into a sauna. We tried to run a portable A/C but it couldn't keep up.<br/>If you're visiting at a time that isn't super hot for Seattle (most of the year) this place is great!"
36035418,530419287,,32154082,Kay,"Alisha’s cottage is quiet, private, clean and comfortable <br/>The location and neighborhood were perfect for my needs<br/>So grateful to have found this gem ??"
49552731,756821422,,321724034,Beate,"Beautiful, very comfortable space on the top floor of the house the cedar tub is amazing for soaking, and very sweet and hospitable couple ????"
19846504,179148049,,3221507,Heather,"We were so happy to find Andrew's place - Queen Anne is one of our favorite neighborhoods in Seattle, and everything about Andrew's place was perfect for our stay. The apartment itself is brand new and pristine; small, but nicely laid out so that the 4 of us didn't feel cramped, with a nice patio for enjoying the morning. The location is a short walk from Fremont shops, restaurants, a PCC grocery store and Sunday farmers market, and also close to a park with a playground. Our family enjoyed it as vacation accommodation, but it would be perfect for business travel as well."
54314661,5.72E+17,,322956261,Tracy,"This listing really suited my needs in terms of location. The bus stop in front of the house is great. It wasn’t far at all from Target, which was convenient.<br/>The fireplace was so cozy & warm. <br/>The listing was spacious, with the exception of the kitchen. But it was perfect for preparing breakfast. <br/>I enjoyed the garden outside the bedroom window.<br/>Having my own parking place was very much appreciated. <br/>My ONLY concern was that the walls aren’t thick, so the neighbors were easy to hear."
34879512,649822674,,32313562,Julia,"the location is pretty convenient, quiet place, and budget price. Melissa is very kind host. Her response is always quick and helpful."

5919096,32391863,,32345011,Lisbeth,"We enjoyed our stay in Ballard Victorian very much. It was such a nice place to stay, spacoius and well equipped. We spent a week visting our daughter who lives in a small apartment just around the corner, and it was so nice to be able to invite her and her family to dinner etc. We really hope to stay here agian next time we come to Seattle."
37830153,594500335,,32369348,Teresa,"This was by far, my best Airbnb experience. Edith is transparent about all the details, she is a above and beyond host! Always responds quickly, if needed on site, she is there as soon as possible. Accommodating and great to talk to! she has great recommendations, ask her about the area! <br/>Sleeping arrangements were perfect. She had great amenities to make the pull out sofa and bedroom bed amazing! <br/>It’s a great location to take public transport and uber. The neighborhood is quiet, and a great place to retire to after a long day. There is so much to love about this stay, Edith really goes above and beyond! I know I will look here again next time I’m in Seattle!"
9580021,55074518,,3237353,Kevin,"Phenomenal rental! Matthew's listing was classy and cozy, with great amenities and easy walking to all of Capitol Hill. I was visiting family for the thanksgiving holiday, and couldn't have been happier with the experience. I highly highly recommend, and will be staying here on my next Seattle trip."
42860814,648403732,,32377501,Matt & Emily,The original place we had was overbooked. Chima offered This spot as a replacement. We were skeptical at first but the new location was a better house and we had absolutely no issues. Chima had great communication.
13533117,94583560,,3240507,Kate,Andrew and James were great hosts and very responsive. Their space is very comfortable and the pictures on the site are very accurate. Easy to get around from their neighborhood.
49962769,4.43E+17,,324095423,Garrett,"This was one of the better Airbnb experiences I've had for sure. The unit is immaculate and had a surprising amount of natural light considering it is a downstairs unit. You can tell the recent renovation was well done, and thoughtful details throughout made that apparent. The bed was comfortable, the heated bathroom floors were nice, the closet shelving/drawers were particularly useful (space to set your bags off the floor), and the kitchen was pretty nice as well. Especially if you're considering staying in a traditional hotel, the free and ample street parking saves at LEAST $30/day.<br/>The location is excellent. Large grocery stores, tons of great restaurants, coffee shops, etc are all very walkable from the house itself, or 2-3 min of driving time at most. <br/>And finally, the host...couldn't have been more accommodating. That can really make or break a stay, but Scott was quick to respond to any questions I had, and immediately fixed the only small hiccup we encountered within literally 2 minutes. If you're looking at a 3-4 star hotel room nearby then you should strongly consider this first."
21199701,217538496,,32420511,Howard,"We were honored to be the first to rent Sam and Heather's apt in Columbia City. It was perfect for our needs. I live in Olympia and was taking my brother out for his 50th birthday and needed a place to crash. We both ended up crashing at this AirBnB - it was HUGE! The front room with sectional couch was my favorite spot but this place was so nice, I felt I needed to step up MY game. Getting in and out was easy - communication from Sam/Heather was outstanding - way more TVs and audio systems than I imagined (which was good - I could watch something in one room while brother could watch something else in another). Having the coffee maker in the morning was super helpful. Love the 3D pic of KC. Don't hesitate to rent this - it's a snag."
45402498,9.21E+17,,324491291,Luisa,"Loved the place and would definitely stay here again! We were there for a busy week so were unable to enjoy the outdoor space unfortunately. The interior was beautifully decorated, comfortable and welcoming. Additionally Chase went the extra mile to leave us snacks and drinks which of course we devoured after a long journey there from the airport with a newborn by foot! (Thank you so much for the snacks, Chase!)<br/>The only suggestions I would add are <br/>-providing more kitchen supplies since we were there for a week and had planned on meal prepping but not a lot of kitchen supplies and ended up buying freezer meals."
27929606,318514852,,32461621,Krystina,"Absolutely loved our stay at the captains suite..if you’re thinking about staying here it’s an absolute must. We were Heidi’s first guests for Airbnb and we were lucky we found this place. Heidi has thought about every little detail to make the apartment a luxurious and comfortable home away from home. Super amazing bed with loads of cushions, soft linen and a thick comfortable mattress. The kitchen was fully equipped with everything we needed and the bathroom had a big shower head with great pressure. Yummy coffee and lots of fruit provided for breakfast. Large and comfortable outdoor seating area with BBQ and mini golf/put. We also really loved the neighbourhood where the apartment is located. There’s a lot of great bars and restaurants within walking distance, a lot of them rated the best in Seattle. You don’t see much of Heidi but we did have the pleasure of meeting here during our stay, and she is super lovely and welcoming. Stay here, you won’t be disappointed with the apartment or location."
40881328,590116120,,324637422,Ulyssis,"It was a wonderful place!! We had been staying in hotels, but it was not the best place for three young kids. When we found this place it wasn’t a crazy price, so we booked it. It was clean and everything was new! It had all the cooking appliances I need. My kids loved it so it was a plus! The view was amazing!!"
7742525,42963254,,32471387,Egemen,Lisa very helpful. It was very nice experience. Nice location. And very comfortable house. Thank you very much for eveything. <br/>

7455832,6.46E+17,,325631428,Shan,The house is so comfortable and clean. It has everything you need and makes you feel like home. I like the one floor house compared some 3 floor townhouse it’s easy for everything. Ryan is very helpful with all questions and service. Great experience here.
8.29E+17,8.7E+17,,32605130,Kristan,"This was the perfect spot for our family. Spacious, very clean, and thoughtfully decorated. If you’re looking for a spot to stay in Seattle, this is it! Can’t wait to come back."

13548374,81754718,,32637921,Charlie,Connie was responsive and friendly and other than the wifi/cable not being installed (for which she generously discounted me) everything was great.
8632651,55561916,,32668698,Candy,Kelly is a fabulous host. We encountered a problem that was outside of her control during our stay and she was quick to respond and was able to move us to this new location. Her homes are welcoming and comfortable. Our family of three was well cared for during our long stay. We slept very comfortably in the king sized bed. All of the bedding was nice and comfy.
5991734,33013383,,32686765,Matt,"The cottage was very nice, and even better than we expected from the posting. The studio cottage was spotless, well maintained and felt brand new. This was our first Airbnb experience, it was easy and well worth it. It was few blocks from the beach and totally quiet throughout the day and night. Jessica provided local information and good directions to the cottage and she was easy to work with."
52064963,6.21E+17,,32706592,Lawrence,"Excellent place to stay in a perfect location. In the midst of downtown with lots of restaurants and bars walking distance. Def recommend Lyft when traveling outside the city as it was cheaper than Uber. The place was really clean, plenty of towels, had shampoo and conditioner which was a nice touch, had a smart tv too. The lock system is really convenient with the app to unlock but also the backup keypad in case I was out of battery. Rooftop view is perfect to see the Space Needle! Overall highly recommend and will def book again when I’m back in Seattle."
25230615,277159520,,32707238,Rick,"This cute lovely house is way more than I expected. Darcy was wonderful, the bed was super comfortable, and the coffee was great. Loved everything about staying here."
42629440,623364563,,327311727,Anders,"Gwyn and Sean are great hosts, made me feel at home in notime!<br/>Perfect position with alot of what one needs within walking distance. I had to shorten my stay due to covid-19 but will most certainly be back!"
39949477,595194478,,327483139,Holly,"Stay here, cute loft style hotel real peaceful. In-between restaurants if you're hungry, free tea and coffee. Cute place."
13173803,142237235,,32768705,Chris,This a very beautiful space and Glen is really awesome. He responds in a very timely manner to any questions and is very attentive to whatever you need. I really enjoyed my stay and would definitely stay here again!
11929388,68018121,,32790386,Steve,"Liz honored our last minute request and provided us with a very neat and clean, newly renovated apartment located in the community of Wallingford. We really enjoyed the area with lots of walking streets, coffee shops, and restaurants nearby. It is centrally located just 10 minutes or so from the downtown with easy access to the freeway. My only regret is that we could only spend 6 days there, I would have loved to stay longer!"
13045179,80829578,,3284858,Laurel,The place is great. The hosts were super friendly and left info about things to do in the area. Check in was super easy and the off-street parking was very convenient. <br/>No tv and not a lot of natural light because it's a basement suite. Lots of space inside the apartment however.
37656744,614334677,,328635653,Jacob,Karen and her Husband are amazing people. This place was above and beyond my expectations. Beautiful views / great setup / perfect quiet location in the city.
18194024,149520398,,32868041,Landon,If your in Seattle for a night or so definitely stay with Shawn! My girlfriend and I were so pleased with the beautiful little private place that had everything you needed. Shawn is really nice to talk with and was very helpful with recommendations; she even further accommodated us after we checked out! She has 2 amazing dogs and an awesome set-up. My girlfriend and I will be back when we revisit the city. Tell Shawn we said hi when you book!
7418814,39863593,,32873049,Elizabeth,"We had a excellent stay with Kelly and co. Everything was as described, and we found ourselves surprised by the quality linens, hospitality, and overall tranquility of the setting. We were there with our teenage daughters, and found the accommodations surpassed our expectations. Fresh coffee in the fridge was a welcome perk, and my husband faved about the toiletries! We especially loved spending quality time with Rocky the dog while we were there. 5 stars all the way! Thank You!"
46857184,725683903,,329121425,Ali,"Great location and very comfortable space! The neighborhood is lovely and only a 15 min walk to Seattle Center and the space needle. Finding a parking spot was never a problem and we were able to walk most places anyway. There is a full time renter on the bottom floor of the house with a separate entrance, who we could hear once in a while, but hardly noticed at all. Otherwise, a nice and quiet neighborhood. I highly recommend Karen’s place and hope to stay again!"
52761885,5.66E+17,,32934732,Carol,This a cozy spot in a great location.
36237679,625779535,,330158312,Bella,Good cheap stAy
23705000,280222219,,33031031,Franklin,Great location. The house was perfect when we arrived. Very responsive if I had questions. Left snacks and a bottle of wine for us which was very unexpected and a really nice touch!
47032823,724413937,,330323360,Luke,Great Stay
850481,52052183,,33046127,Michael,"This is a decently equipped townhouse in a wonderful and spacious area... My wife and I were moving to the Seattle area, and stayed here while we were looking for long-term housing - It was great to have for that purpose. <br/><br/>A few things kept this from being perfect. It appeared clean at first glance, but we noticed things like much of the kitchenware that had been put back dirty, and there was a load of sheets/towels in the dryer that had not been put away - Surely the result of whoever stayed there prior, but reminded me more of a ""common room"" at times than a private dwelling. Additionally, the sink had a leak that was there before we arrived - We didn't notice it until it had leaked through to the floor below. Leaks happen, and things go wrong - but this was broken prior to our arrival. Things like this can happen anywhere, and the hosts were ultimately responsive to these issues, but it's unfortunate that they were present before we arrived, and communicating them wasn't always simple. There were a couple of maintenance visits that were frustrating, as I felt that the workers didn't have a clear idea of what to do. However, Elisa was always very pleasant to deal with, and definitely cares about these issues, and about the house and guest comfort.<br/><br/>There were other small things - like the closet doors that didn't close entirely and were a bit off-track, and the heating being either completely off or absurdly hot - that on their own, wouldn't be a big deal, but were a bit frustrating when taken as a whole.<br/><br/>But overall, I don't think there's much to complain about, especially when comparing to other units this size in the area. It's a great area, with easy access to everything, and the townhouse itself feels much larger than it actually is. Nothing was too noisy, and it was ultimately comfortable. I work remotely, and I had no problem working from the townhouse while we were staying in it. <br/><br/>If you need housing this size for more than a couple of weeks, it's hard to go wrong here."
7037522,37803416,,33052393,Silvia,"We had a nice and welcoming arrival. We were the first ones in there and it was really nice, clean and new. It was a really nice area, quiet but still close to the city. We had a really nice time there."
8.4E+17,8.58E+17,,33072087,Rahul,"great place and nice location! close to downtown and easily accessible to I5 and 90. parking a bit tight since lots of construction and new house being built, but always able to find a spot."
14991780,110819845,,33135201,Erica,"Great experience in this house. We had a large group that loved how cozy and comfortable the place was. Short walk to all of the restaurants and bars of interest in Capitol Hill. <br/><br/>Highly recommend for large groups. 2 of the ""bedrooms"" are actually unattached rooms in the backyard, which we didn't mind at all as those who wanted more privacy choose those rooms. Many of the sleeping spaces are in a loft-type arrangement, so this house is ideal for people who will be on the same schedule."
2670365,33176974,,33158970,Wyatt,"Absolutely beautiful neighborhood and super-quiet, within walking distance of great near locations (15th st. & Capitol Hill) for evening fun. Matthew, our host, was a star - communicative, organized, friendly, and just the right amount of help without being 'too much'. The room is perched on the top floor - windows to the trees, comfortable bed, great bathroom. We will be back. . . . . ."
42648598,623946449,,33159278,Melissa,"This place was great—nice open layout with lots of light. The nightclub was closed when I stayed here so I can’t speak to the noise. It was very quiet during my stay. The place was very clean and the host was responsive, flexible, and helpful. It’s so nice having a whole condo during a trip. Short walk to Whole Foods and other shops. Market House Meats on the corner makes great breakfast sandwiches too. <br/>You can’t beat this location—you can walk to Pike Place Market, lots of downtown destinations, and Capitol Hill—and there’s easy access to the freeway. <br/>There is a skylight in the bedroom, which is a nice feature, but as a result the room doesn’t get completely dark if that matters to you."
22630322,236209163,,33172196,Jonathan,The house is sparkling clean. The entire place is Amazon Alexa enabled so you can change the color of the lights and control EVERYTHING with your voice. The master bedroom is amazing and the shower alone makes it worth it. Hosts are awesome. Best Airbnb we have ever been to.
3772674,18604733,,331733,James,"Kim is a conscientious host and her family's place has all the conveniences you really need. The Wifi signal was excellent, and that's high on my priority list. The available driveway parking was also a major plus. And the drive to the central Seattle area was only about 15 to 20 minutes. <br/>Bonus: bed was comfortable and there's a nice back porch/yard you can enjoy. Would I stay there again? Yes. <br/><br/>"
49926704,762373473,,332011310,Terra,Our stay was great. The staff were so friendly and responsive. I was thrilled with the location and accommodations. This place is great.
6304139,34587637,,33207004,Bob,Lovely self contained apartment (Pesha and family live the floor above) with everything you need in a very nice and very convenient part of town. We were Pesha's first guests and they did everything they could to make us comfortable and they succeeded superbly well. We loved it and will be back again.
19770530,173700977,,33208533,Joel,"Joshua's place was a perfect stop for a short weekend in Seattle. The location was great. The apartment was affordable, and communication was easy."
44016360,651631605,,332244445,Juan,"Dorthy made us feel right at home. Her kitchen is fully stocked for cooking and has a good table for 4 to eat dinner on. We arrived in 2 vehicles and she has plenty of parking. The suite has an amazing view. It’s also very spacious. Loved the Roku on the tv. It’s a smart tv so you can log in and watch your Netflix like we did. The private shower is pure luxury and very relaxing. I can honestly say I would be back. We stayed here for a full month and have nothing bad to say. If you have any questions she will answer you immediately. And don’t get me started on her manager John, he is a good man. He will resolve any issue you may have ASAP. Thank Dorthy and John. May God bless you both."
31545482,420461426,,33229020,Ivan,"If you're looking for the complete Seattle experience you have come to the right place. Everything about this quaint little home was great. They had it all, from a comfortable bed to the cutest decor. Bill, the co host really goes above and beyond to make sure you have a great experience. The best part about the location was the easy access to the metro stop that takes you directly to all the amazing spots that Seattle has to offer. My girlfriend and I had an amazing time. When we come back we will definitely be looking to book our stay here."
6705584,35160961,,33230307,Ben,"Nice place for the money, as hotels in the university district are far more expensive. Parking was difficult, but not impossible, but you don't really need a car to access all the shops and restaurants nearby. Melissa was a good host, and just upgraded the wifi, so Internet access was great. I stayed a week and it was only noisy once on a Saturday night, then perfectly quiet thereafter. Shower was ocassionally lacking in power, but was always hot. Would recommend for 1-2 people traveling on a budget."
35915436,498474924,,33238290,Savannah,This was the most amazing vacation we have been on. It was my first ever time to Seattle and the location felt very central to everything that we had planned for our weekend. Our hosts were so incredibly nice and went the extra mile to make sure we were comfortable. We will absolutely stay here again for our next visit!
26756649,318366002,,3326151,Alejandro,We have stayed here several times and everything is always perfect. You just can’t beat this place and we recommend it to anyone.
1628210,35499294,,33278130,Tom,Outstanding location. Great for short walks to great restaurants and coffee shops. Place was very clean and had good accommodations!
23703054,282186746,,33297075,Jc,"OVERALL: 5-stars (*****) STAY: 5 days PROS: Great neighborhood, local restaurants, local bars, responsive host, good WIFI, reasonably close to everything downtown, well appointed-property CONS: stairs, stairs, stairs, and hills all around the house"
7091397,39317403,,33310888,Skylar,"Barbara was very sweet, she even offered to order us dinner after our drive from Montana to Seattle because we were stuck in traffic. the kitchen was beautiful and spotless, as was the rest of the bungalow. great location and very close to transportation."
4892357,36874271,,33320906,Catherine,"I am so happy I stayed here! I moved to Seattle from New York, and this apartment was a great first home in the city. Super convenient to lots of restaurants and even for people heading to the east side. The arboretum is walkable as well as grocery stores and a farmers market. I wish I could have stayed here long while looking for an apartment. Robert was a great host."
47047526,726238102,,33326776,Usman,Great hospitality by Blueground staff.
44155604,647845503,,333805759,Meranda,"This girls trip is one we will never forget. The home was even better than we could have imagined! Sparkling clean, spacious, and so affordable for the value of the home. We loved spending our meals on the rooftop in our old neighborhood of Capitol Hill, Seattle. Everything is so close by and walkable in this neighborhood, but we opted to get take out (our favorite Taco's Chukis is so close, and Hot Mama's pizza of course) and enjoy all of our meals on the lovely rooftop. We will definitely recommend your beautiful home to all of our friends and stay here on our next visit to our college town. We can't we wait to be back! Thank you a million times!"
33690503,439823581,,33396814,Tracey,Sparkling clean apartment with plenty of linens and towels. Great value and excellent location.
17611308,159825452,,33403684,Ryan,"I stayed here over the weekend, and found it to be the perfect location to enjoy all that downtown Seattle has to offer. Pike Place market is literally a few minutes walk away, and downtown Seattle, with the shops, restaurants, bars, etc. are easily accessible by public transit, bike, or foot. Exploring the pier is also easy; the aquarium is so close! <br/>The unit itself is quiet and clean, with a really comfortable bed. Gets good light, especially in the morning and is quite spacious. I especially liked the door code access; it's way easier than keeping track of a key. That's one of those things that you don't think you need until you've experience it - it's so convenient! <br/>Check in and out were a breeze. The owner or a representative were always available whenever I had any questions. I'm not familiar with Apple TV, but a simple email prompted an immediate call and walk through of how to access what I wanted to watch. Tremendous service! <br/>I would 100% choose to stay here again. The combination of convenience, cleanliness, service, and comfort put this at the very top of my list of places to stay in Seattle!"

6734621,35033110,,33457662,Sterling,"Our stay with Andrew was fantastic! We were greeted punctually with a welcome card and a bottle of Prosecco. Andrew gave us a tour of his beautiful four story home upon arrival. He then explained to us that a key code would be used for our access, which in my opinion is the easiest way. Andrew's home is in a great location, and just minutes away from downtown Seattle, as well as some of the main attractions in Seattle (Pike Place Market). The neighbors were all very friendly and we felt safe throughout our entire stay. His home was exactly as listed, and very clean. I would HIGHLY recommend his beautiful home, especially if you are with a group looking to enjoy this beautiful city. Thanks again Andrew!"
24695469,266852770,,33462800,Jeffrey,"Stephanie's place is warm and inviting, and a perfect respite from the city. I also liked that her house is within 5 minutes walk to the Express C bus to downtown which spared me from driving and finding parking. The area is quiet and good for sleeping, yet a very close walk to lots of fun shops and restaurants. A number of grocery stores were en-route to the house. About the house itself; she obviously put a lot of work into making this a very comfortable , convenient, and clean place to stay. The decor is beautiful and tasteful. I loved the outdoor deck and comfortable outdoor furniture for sunny days. There were extra towels and quilts for guests. I also loved the spa-feel of the shower downstairs. The bed I slept in was so comfortable! She even had filtered water in the kitchen sink and in the showers. I would definitely stay there again!"
34758003,460203874,,33521786,Ruthrapathy,"Adjua's place was wonderful. It was very clean and beautiful. It is so close to Pike's place (~15 minute drive). The neighborhood is very safe, and lots of street parking is available. Adjua is an excellent host, she guided us all through checkin to checkout and responded very quickly for any queries."
36201350,605987167,,335935876,Andy,"I found this hotel to be quite over-the-top. It's focused on millenial ""furbaby"" parents who love their dogs. Much of the decor was pineapple themed, from the room card, to coffee mugs(available for purchase). Lots of gimmicky in-room purchases you can make for your fur babies. You put down a deposit in case you decide you want to take home the plush husky in the room, or some treat baskets. Warning to the parents with small children. I'm sure some people would love this.<br/>Besides that, it was a fine place to stay. It was clean and quiet. Right next to the monorail, but I didn't find it loud. There were a few families staying next door. Good place to bring kids(human or dog). <br/>Fairly standard breakfast, but it was included in the cost and I can't complain. Wifi seemed strong as well."
654734,2613239,,3361227,Chris,"Grace was extremely hospitable, providing us with everything we needed for a comfortable stay, including towels and toiletries, simple cooking ingredients for the kitchen, and even a queen size air mattress to accommodate our 4 guests. The condo was in a perfect location, too. Walking distance to anything you'd need to get to in Seattle. Highly recommended."
6438518,35235691,,33671318,Marie,We loved this place. Nice and clean and a great location to all the Fremont/Phinney neighborhood's Seattle has to offer. We will be returning again for sure.

54223279,5.71E+17,,336953745,Barbara Arlette,"The neighborhood is nice and quite, if your looking for a place were there's not much nice around, this is perfect! All guests/people that's staying help keep the house clean and someone comes to clean the house once a week so it's never dirty. There's plenty of space in the common areas, the kitchen is big and equipped."
7349029,38800212,,33729565,Ariel,This was my BEST airbnb experience ever! The place and view was gorgeous!! Ron was awesome and very accommodating. I would love to stay again.
3770248,17601580,,337540,Mislav,"The place was really easy to find and close to bus stations coming from downtown/Capitol Hill. The University town nearby is a nice place to take walks around. The building was really quiet, except of course for the garbage truck each morning, but that was indicated in the listing and I didn't mind much either way. Beds are comfortable, but wifi signal not strong enough for anything more substantial than checking messages. I never met my host in person but she helped me out over intercom whenever I had questions."
17865690,142949444,,33783537,William,"This was a terrific place to stay. The furnishings are all new and very comfortable. The neighborhood is quiet and feels secluded, but is close to everything we wanted to do. Finally....the heated floors feel amazing on the tootsies, and now I want them in my own home! <br/>Thanks again guys for a wonderful stay!"
41003115,616534193,,338155935,Corey,No need to pack heavy here folks this place has it all Down to Wine and laundry soap I really enjoyed my stay
16232208,120773611,,3382538,Brayden,"Jody and Ray were super welcoming. We found this location perfect for a get together of friends to come together, relax and play a great evening of games."
6263270,44211499,,33934572,Dana,"Kristin and her husband greeted at their apartment - the place is hotel quality. Very modern and clean and looks as it does in the pictures. The location is great as it's walking distance to Pike Place Market and other city attractions. Neighborhood is very cool - great restaurants/bars, but a little seedy at night - the property is super secure so we felt fine getting back there. Tip: Be sure to double check how to use the lock - we were worried we were going to break it in the door."
16617445,664465689,,339375765,Hector,Great view and great stay.
6490453,35146363,,33950639,Chen,"The house is very large, modern and clean. The room in the basement is very comfortable. It has a separate toilet, as well as 50-inch television. It's own private space. If possible I really want to stay longer."

42672886,622478706,,339996349,Catherine,"This air bnb was sparkling clean, and provided everything one could need for short or long term stay. It is conveniently close to at least 3 groceries, restaurants, spas, a major gym, yoga and Pilates studios, a park, the beach, post offices and many other conveniences.<br/>Brian and Anh are awesome hosts who made sure I had everything I needed and kept checking in to see how I was doing in self-isolation and social distancing so I didn’t feel so alone in a foreign country. <br/>All in all, my stay in West Seattle Best Seattle was great despite the unfortunate event of Covid19 because the house was clean, comfortable, fully equipped and safe and Brain and Anh are the perfect hosts."
22265012,5.12E+17,,340108389,William,"We had an amazing stay in Kaylas west Seattle home. The house was great. It was clean and very cozy. The bed was vey comfy, and the living room couch and tv with streaming services was perfect for winding down at night. It was very dog friendly. The backyard area was amazing and the sauna was like the icing on the cake. Neighborhood was awesome with lots of excellent little coffee shops and food close by. We recommend supreme pizza, bebop waffle, and the sound and fog coffee shop. This isn’t to good to be true. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would love to stay again whenever visiting Seattle."
43554835,627383134,,340876414,Deejaune,I very much advise and suggest hosting with Li !! She is an amazing host very understanding and very fast responses !!!
34505467,472479402,,34111659,Robert,This is a beautifully decorated and well-equipped apartment in a quiet residential area. There are a few restaurants nearby and Green Lake is an easy walk. There's a regular bus service to downtown.
47856630,767401203,,341866056,Matt,"There are great Airbnbs, and then there is this Airbnb. Absolutely, positively superlative; if you are heading to Seattle, this is, without a doubt, the place to stay! <br/>The house is incredible. Beautiful furniture, top-scale appliances (equipped with ‘smart’ tech), two offices (great for working remotely), a yard…the list goes on. Not only is this new house fantastic, but the hosts do such a great job decorating it with lovely, homey touches. <br/>The location is fantastic. Central to everything you’d like to visit in Seattle: Seattle Center, Downtown Seattle, ‘Funky’ Fremont, Ballard, etc. Queen Anne itself is very lovely, full of parks, restaurants and cute stores.<br/>Finally, Christophe and Dorette are excellent hosts. Super responsive and kind, they went the extra mile to ensure that we had a great stay.<br/>We are so thankful that we had the chance to stay here; if you’re reading this review, that means you have that chance too!"
42646755,622481631,,34223013,Zach,James offers a great place in an awesome location! Everything was very clean and James was always available to answer any questions I had. Definitely worth the stay.

36237111,629280838,,342964335,Zach,Was better than most hotels your going to stay at. You get the privacy you want and the room was much bigger then the average hotel room.
6117473,34492701,,34457214,Katie,Great place to stay. The back porch is so peaceful. Relaxed atmosphere. Farm fresh goodies to eat. Very laid back. Will definitely be back. Jessie was a gracious hostess.

Everything was very clean and looked even better than the pictures. Would absolutely stay here again, thanks for having us! :)"
27608157,327904180,,3454382,Sophie,"It’s a pretty basic space. Laptop friendly workspace is a little bit of a stretch. Shower will leak water onto the floor even if you’re very careful with the shower curtain (there were two towels so I just used one to absorb the water).<br/>Overall workable. I checked in a day earlier than planned and so some of the time to prepare the space wasn’t available. I agreed to it being a bit more basic than normal. If it weren’t for that, this would be a negative review, but I really appreciate being able to come in a day early with very little notice, so it all evens out for me."
27680098,633631141,,345695708,Dan,Very cute front yard
7987854,56910945,,34594731,Rebekah,"Awesome!!!! I'm a traveling nurse and lived here with a fellow nurse for 3 months. Great location to walk anywhere you want. Right below pikes market and the belltown district, which is filled with restaurants and bars. Can even walk to city target in 5 minutes! Amazing window views from the living room, patio, and bedrooms. Favorite part was walking and running on the water front with views of Mt. Rainer and the Olympic mountain range. Heath was so helpful from the moment we made contact. He helped us find a second parking spot and was flexible with us extending a extra week. He always would respond to any question or concern promptly. Highly recommend this place!!"

43531859,628007616,,348025070,Becca,"Isabel and Tyler did an amazing job making us feel welcome. The little touches they put into this airbnb really made us feel special. We stayed for a week and couldn't have asked for a better home away from home. The apartment was private, secure, well take care of and the location was perfect. Walking distance to grocery stores, plenty of parking, and a delicious Mexican resturaunt right across the street! It's everything we could've asked for and more, 10/10 would recommend to anyone looking to stay in the Seattle area. Thank you so much for hosting us!!"
14670084,103469539,,34830151,Jennifer,"We enjoyed our stay very much! It definitely had a ""home away from home"" feeling---we were able to relax, sleep comfortably, cook our own meals when we wanted to (in a beautiful kitchen) and we found the location to be very convenient too. Kerry was great with communication! We would definitely stay again."
11128182,62682508,,34837993,Michael,Bobby was very accommodating and helpful. He was flexible in finding a time that worked to meet us at such a short notice.

38796485,538549295,,34917012,Joel,"The walk to downtown Leschi is adorable. The basement was private and easy to get in and out without bothering host and neighbors. Parking was easy and had plenty of spaces during the middle of the day. The view of Bellevue was quite picturesque. By far the best part is that even though you are minutes from downtown Seattle, this place has a great relaxing vibe to help you unwind after you've been in traffic and meetings all day :)"

15299300,108135365,,35087566,Stephanie,"The listing was accurate. There were a few K-cups for coffee and 2 granola bars. The cooking items were very limited - no chopping knives, large pans, oil or spices. <br/><br/>The space was clean and looked like the pictures."

6002165,35712876,,35132192,Charley,"The Huey House was fantastic from booking to our departure. It's in the coolest neighborhood and the location was perfect for a family weekend. This is very much a family home, not a professional rental. The Huey Family was super accomodating and straightforward. When we arrived there was a basket with beer and juices for the kids and they were cool enough to have toys for the kids laid out and soap/shampoo in the bathrooms. There was plenty of everything and we felt welcome in their home. We are grateful."
15746020,131920399,,35148972,Deborah,"Michael is a kind and gracious host. Very prompt in returning communications, helped us get our bags into the apartment. The guest area is by itself on the entry floor...a real plus in terms of coming and going. We were visiting our son who lives nearby and he was easily able to pick us up and drop us off without feeling as if we were disrupting anyone's home. The bedroom was lovely and clean, the bed itself SO comfortable. The bedroom is just outside the bedroom and is private for only your use, which is another plus. I could leave our toiletries out for the duration of our stay. The price was great for the location and the space. Michael himself was always available for advice and conversation. I hope he has many, many future guests!"
677266,2339304,,3515772,Mary Beth,"Angielena was a wonderful host. She gave us a great introduction to the neighborhood and the art center, and was available when we needed anything, always friendly and cheerful. Her dogs were sweet and adorable, and quiet.

10344631,81110507,,3525676,Izabela,"Staying at John's was a great experience. The place is spacious, was clean and tidy, and I appreciated having a bedroom with a separate bathroom. The townhouse has three levels so it offers a lot of privacy. Public transport, a grocery store and a park are all nearby. John responded to the messages promptly and even though he was away when I arrived, everything was ready. John is a gracious host, very friendly, happy and approachable. Highly recommended!"

We will definitely stay with her again on future trips to Seattle.

Location of apartment was centrally located, not too far at all to walk to pike place or to the light rail. Bed was very comfortable too! Host was responsive via app as well as by calling. This will definitely be on our return trip list for places to stay."
7275464,38459696,,35664887,Jay,"I just got a chance to catch up on things after a week attending an event up in Seattle. <br/><br/>The Private Studio was very cozy and modern. The entire place was as upscale as any 4+ Star hotel rating if not higher. I would highly recommend this place to anyone who is visiting and wants his/her private studio in the backyard of a Capital Hill suburban home. I come and go at my own convenience with a private entrance and a backyard to relax to.<br/><br/>In addition to the awesome private studio, Bobby, the host was super friendly and helpful. I have a bag full of dirty clothing, which I need to have clean so I could wear them for the next several days; there were no laundromat nearby and Bobby offered to clean them for me while I had to rush out to attend the events that I was up in Seattle for. This was above and beyond what was called for and Bobby doesn't have to do my laundry, but he did and I am grateful.<br/><br/>Thank you for a wonderful place for me to be able to enjoy and get to know Seattle."
48202083,736330228,,35673489,Savannah,"Zach and Amanda’s place was great. The highlight for us was the living room, with the comfy couch and TV. And while we didn’t use the backyard much, it was great having it and feeling like you were out of the city, while being just about as centrally located as possible. We walked most places — try Love + Flour bakery. <br/>Highly recommend. Exactly what you’re looking for. Turn down the heat at night bc it gets a tad warm. <br/>It was a clean and spacious set up and the hosts were super responsive. They immediately answered any questions we had and made it clear that if something wasn’t satisfactory to let them know so they could fix it. <br/>We hope to be back!"

45057913,667579447,,357058139,Skyler,Great place. Great amenities. Not the best of characters on the streets in the morning. The bar below is nice and The Pizza Professionals was the best. The Air Bob people really took care of me.
7262142,44862756,,35750630,Rita,"Our best AirBnB experience so far. Kathleen responded to messages promptly and was super helpful and friendly during our stay. The apartment is perfect, comfortable and clean with everything you need. It's about a 10 minute walk to lively Columbia City shops/restaurants etc. Kathleen gave us maps and lots of recommendations of things to do according to our interests. <br/>We would recommend to everyone, especially at the price which is very reasonable."

25479165,271954882,,35825274,Clare,"This lovely house was the perfect discovery for my Seattle stay. A classic gem with an amazing front porch perfect for that first cup of coffee or evening glass of wine after a long day of sightseeing. Loved the space: beautiful floors and furnishings throughout, great dining room & kitchen for cooking in (which I did mornings AND evenings), lots of space throughout...and so close to Seattle Light Rail, which takes you downtown AND to the airport in just minutes. This house is a real find and Beacon Hill is a lovely, historic Seattle neighborhood. Take advantage of walking a block over to Bar del Corso at least one evening for an amazing dinner-- one of the best restaurants in all of Seattle! I will DEFINITELY stay here again!!"
46974831,5.98E+17,,35895531,Libby,"Such a nice townhouse tucked away on a side street but within walking distance of lots of shops, restaurants and the Sunday Farmers Market. Julie was super helpful and responsive!"
31861361,459826959,,359082,Quentin,"Todd is a great host!<br/>The apartment is in a luxury building located 1-block from the best of Ballard. We found the space to be clean, stylish and quiet. It was the perfect home base for our adventures around the neighborhood and the city of Seattle. <br/>Todd met with us upon arrival and showed us the entire building (roofdeck, multiple entryways, gated garden, etc). The security system in the building is easy-to-use with access pads throughout the property. The apartment itself was sparkling clean, with everything you'd need to cook a meal. Though we ended up eating out ever meal due to the ideal location in the Ballard neighborhood, we found restaurants, cafes and coffee shops.<br/>Great host, apartment and neighborhood. 5-star... highly recommend!"
50899512,1E+18,,35918976,Elaine,"For starters the home is so beautifully decorated and charming. We loved the fireplace and all the touches! Beds were so comfortable, street is quiet, and the location (!!!) is ideal. We took the light rail downtown which is about 2 or 3 blocks, and green lake is a super cute and so close! Probably a six minute walk. We had a car so having parking was great. Hayley warned us the parking is city size, but we were able to fit the car. Beds are so comfortable. Hayley was very sweet and communicative with all her suggestions for the city. Will be staying here again!"
15281555,112588715,,35923292,Sinead,"I booked this accommodation for family who were visiting from Boston and their experience was fantastic. Jenny gave us clear detailed directions as to how to access the apartment and everything worked seamlessly. The apartment offers great privacy. The location is great - Just minutes from the I-5 and within walking distance (10 mins) from Green Lake park. There is a store, cafe, bars and restaurants less than 5 minutes walk from the apartment. <br/><br/>Jenny is a wonderful host - we met her to say hello and she was friendly and helpful. <br/><br/>The apartment itself is spacious, bright and airy with all of the amenities you could need for a weekend stay (or longer). The bed is extremely comfortable and the bed linen is high quality. <br/><br/>We would highly recommend Jenny's apartment to AirBnB guests and will definitely be booking it again for future visitors."

15053620,101874060,,35966905,Danielle,"Matt's place was perfect for my time in Seattle! Can't beat the location – right in the middle of so many awesome bars and restaurants, literally ON a beautiful park, and walkable (or public transit-able – just ask Matt, he's super passionate about transit!) to Seattle sightseeing like the space needle, waterfront, and Pike Place. Not to mention, that mattress was just what the doctor ordered after a long day of exploring."

36773048,516711273,,36134270,Zak And Lindsey,"Wow! Looking for a relaxing hideaway near Seattle, with upgraded features and the coziness of home? No joke, this is the place. My wife and I explored Washington for 8 days, and originally booked only one night at the Admirals Nest. We loved it so much, we booked two additional nights. Jesse and Maren have really gone above and beyond with making the space feel like a private getaway with the luxuries of a modern city, and the comfort of home. We were blown away with the spa shower, heated bathroom floors, comfortable living space and bed, and the inviting private patio with a view of the city! Their place is the perfect spot if your looking for a little escape into the PNW paradise, without having to travel too far from Seattle. At the end of our trip, my wife and I referred to the Admirals Nest as our home away from home (GA). Jesse and Maren are the perfect hosts, and we will be sure to come back next time we are in Washington! Seriously, you’d be foolish not to book this place."
703058,2415727,,3618396,Shelby,"great house, very quiet neighborhood, but easy walk to restaurants,shops and killer ice cream. Craig made us feel very welcomed. Will definitely stay again. I couldn't get stars to work but all 5 stars."
1802663,8273032,,3618800,Annabeth,"Ron & his wife have created a lovely space to getaway and relax in the heart of Seattle. We were looking for a quiet, comfortable, clean spot preferably with a hot-tub....and this place was perfect. Ron was friendly and inviting and they thought of everything. Comfortable bed, bathrobes & slippers for the short private trek to the hot-tub to boot! Thank you Ron, we'll stay again!<br/>"
20212882,202088459,,36213413,Cuong,"Perfect place for family travel. The house is new, clean and quiet. All the appliances are new and high quality. <br/>Just need to drive 10 minutes to the downtown.<br/>Definitely will return again."
356248,103651591,,3627724,Sara,"Everything was exactly as pictured and Tara was extremely helpful with all the details she provided re: check-in. She was in fact making some changes to the apartment and did her best to complete these changes in time in order to accommodate our employee! Dave made a point of mentioning how fantastic the view is, in particular. Would definitely recommend!"
9435521,207676219,,36278180,Liam,"Had a great stay! We were a few hours later than expected getting into town but Christa was there to graciously welcome us and introduce us to her cats when we arrived. The place was beautiful and clean, and there were even towels and toothbrushes for forgetful travellers. I felt comfortable in the space and having a code for the door made it easy to go come and go without worrying about keys. This was my first time staying at an Airbnb, and I was very happy with it. They seemed to have thought of everything."
53117022,5.76E+17,,36279150,Gabby,"First of all, all the photos shown on air bnb initially were not the unit we moved into. Photos were changed to current unit day of move in. <br/>The internet was very spotty all day. The landlord suggests you get your own internet subscription for a consistent connection. Factor that in if you work from home or enjoy streaming from anywhere other than the living room. We were told basic streaming for Netflix would be okay, but not the case. <br/>The washing machine is very loud and old. Only accepting quarters, it is $4 total to wash and dry laundry. Price was increased during stay. <br/>The oven’s dials had worn off so there was no way to know the temperature until we bought an oven thermometer.<br/>Landlord is very responsive. Issues with we had with some water leaking from bathroom sink was resolved in a timely manner<br/>We loved the location, there was lots of free parking very close to the home, and the proximity to the lake is amazing. Lots of great restaurants nearby and Daniel has a lot of suggestions for things to do in Seattle if you’re not familiar. We enjoyed being able to throw a duralog on the fireplace during the chilly winter. We loved living in Eastlake and the place has its charm, but be prepared to spend on basic things (laundry, internet, appliances, cooking utensils.) <br/>Futon and bed were pretty uncomfortable for a long stay unfortunately so made it rough for us to hang out in our space comfortably. For a short stay place is great. It has the old Seattle apartment charm. If you’re not spending a lot of time hanging out in the apartment, we recommend."
7871885,44383007,,36306062,Georgia,Super cute studio in a beautiful neighborhood in Capitol Hill. I requested a very last minute reservation and Eric was very quick with his response to me. The studio was very clean and exactly as the photos showed it. My daughter and I really enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend it to others.
22715967,234695460,,36309850,Michel,"What can I say about such a wonderful place to stay in the heart of Seattle. Eric and I love this condo and it feels like home to us. It is in Belltown within walking distance to Pike's Market, shopping at the department stores, small boutique stores, wonderful restaurants, outdoor statute garden, the harbor, the ferry to the islands and more. It is right on top of Macrina's bakery so if you don't want to make your own coffee in the fabulous coffee maker in the flat, you go downstairs for the best latte and pastry or just a fabulous breakfast. The condo is so comfortable and spotlessly clean. The kitchen is well stocked to cook from either a market (there is a whole foods within about 15 minutes driving from the condo) or Pike's market. There are also small markets within walking distance. The internet is exceptionally strong. There was never a problem with hot water and having two fresh robes to cozy up in was super. There was nothing like sitting and looking at the bay from the living or the bedroom. We do not like a bath and this condo was perfect for us because it has just a walk in shower. While it is on the main street we did not mind the noise with the windows open and with them closed you really didn't bother us at all. The owners are just the friendliest most responsive and fabulous couple. We didn't have to wait for one of them to meet us at the condo and we could call them at any time. We have stayed at many places all over the world and I can say this is one of our favorite. We will be back. Thank you again Deana and Dave. Michel & Eric"
13641844,85330732,,36360202,Kirsten,"This is a fantastic neighborhood - you can walk to many incredible restaurants and Seven coffee shop is right around the corner. The house is decorated with great eclectic furnishings and original art and if you like cool, older homes, this is it! The bed/bedding was top notch. Fantastic back yard for al fresco dining or relaxing. Ashley was super fun, friendly, and informative. Would definitely return."

Everything was very clean and we felt so comfortable and taken care of. It is a great location in a very nice neighborhood very close to everything we wanted to do. Very close to the university, shopping, good restaurants, beautiful Lake Washington, and downtown. We walked to the lightrail and it was easy and fun! We look forward to our next visit. Five stars all around!"

You cannot beat the location and ease of access to everything Seattle has to offer. Tiffany was fast to respond to all our needs and included thoughtful touches to the apartment like soft towels, fully equipped kitchen, and medicine cabinet items. The apartment exceeded our expectations and was perfect for a weekend in Capitol Hill. Highly recommend!"

Thanks heaps for also showing me some of your favourite places!<br/><br/>The room is nice and has a desk as well as plenty of storage; good bed for a couple or single traveler.<br/><br/>If timed well, commuting to downtown (via bus #106 and light rail) can be about half an hour during off-peak and closer to 45 minutes during peak hours (only some minutes more to UW campus). SeaTac airport is close and easy to reach with the same connections; no airplane noise though and quiet mixed neighbourhood.<br/><br/>I hope to be back to Seattle sometime and would love to stay with you again!"
47924335,730232818,,365665157,Gladene “Glad”,"Great communication with the Hostess, clean and convenient location. However I did let the Hostess know of one item that would make this a revisit for my boyfriend and myself. That would be a tv to cancel out the noice made by others and the rush of water in the wall. (Which those two things are not in the owners control) Just trying to be helpful."
32609678,8.59E+17,,365697387,Amy,"We had a fantastic stay at Chris' place! The house was both spacious and cozy, and well appointed for our long term stay. We especially enjoyed the gas fireplace, and the proximity to the Arboretum for daily walks. Madison Park is a great little neighborhood all around, with fantastic restaurants just around the corner from the house, like Voila! and Bar Cantinetta. We loved both the relative quiet of the neighborhood, as well as the proximity to downtown, so really felt like we got to benefit from having the best of both worlds. Thank you for everything, Chris! We really enjoyed our stay."
48804710,742204658,,365826486,Troy,The location and the condo were great. The shower was particularly nice. We enjoyed our trip to Seattle much more thanks to the condo unit.
13689184,86734784,,36629697,Melissa,A wonderful and cute home to stay while we were visiting family in Seattle. There were plenty of outdoor spaces in which to hang out. We loved the porch swing (you can heat up some coffee or tea in the morning)!

52518496,5.27E+17,,36746732,Lauren,"out of all the AirBnB's I've stayed in, Taylor's is by far the best, especially for the price. its roomier, clean, has everything you need and parking was not an issue. <br/>the bed was extremely comfortable. so much so, I asked what the mattress was so Icould replace my own, at home. the TV is on a swivel so we can watch TV from bed and the building is very quiet.<br/>Something the owners have no control over and is the garbage collection during the week. it's loud and is very early in the AM. again, the owners cannot do anything to change that. <br/>also, remember to lock your car doors. <br/>please consider this space when you book Seattle. it's a perfect spot, as is the building."

The kitchen space and bedroom were bigger than I expected. Nory responded quickly and added nice small touches (coffee, tea, granola bars)."
11462366,71579540,,36812873,Ashlie,"This was an amazing location with beautiful sunrise and sunset views... You see the ocean from the front windows and are a street back from the main drag. Everything was updated and cozy as well. Do be prepared for about a block walk from the car to the house, unless you have a very small car that can park in the garage. The walk was pleasant however. Loved taking a morning jog along the beach! Thank you for a wonderful experience and we hope to stay again soon!"
14166071,91732311,,36815792,John,"Eli and his family were super hosts during our visit to Seattle. He put an extra bed in the apartment for us without us even asking, and when we had car trouble the whole family pitches in to help. My kids were right at home in the neighborhood. There's a fantastic park/playground just down the street and a great coffee shop we enjoyed. The location is great, just enough out of the busy city to relax, but close enough to get where you want to go in minutes. We'd definitely stay again!"

21013305,203880204,,37087786,Jimmy,We rented the entire house and it was amazing. There were 6 of us and a baby and the house worked great for us. There was plenty of parking in the front and was only about a 10 minute drive to downtown.<br/>Each room has its own bathroom and the entire house has heated floors. There was a problem with the heater the first night and Sherry had it checked first thing in the morning. She probably would have done it the same day but we checked in very late (2AM) and she probably didn't see my messages. We just cranked the fireplace full blast and that warmed the rooms up a bit.<br/>The rooms were very spacious with plenty of storage. Everything was clean and there was even an aeropress and electric kettle in the kitchen. would definitely book again for a group trip to Seattle.
52995284,5.44E+17,,370885446,Alexsis,You will enjoy this big house in the Queen Ann district. It has 3 floors with bedrooms on each one. The kitchen is large and fairly well equipped. The owner is very responsive to any questions. The Queen Ann district is a little difficult to get in and out of but it is worth the drive. The decks 2 are great places to hang out. Would definitely rent again.
6678058,37531189,,37089153,Christine,"My husband and I had the pleasure of staying here for a few days, and were thrilled with every part of our visit. The house is charming, set in a beautiful, peaceful neighborhood. The apartment upstairs was incredibly clean and comfortable, with lovely views, a lot of natural light, a very cozy bedroom, and a thoughtfully-stocked kitchen. Jeffrey and his wife were very warm and welcoming, and made us feel instantly at home. <br/><br/>We were honored to be the first Airbnb guests at Petits Chênes Anglais, and cannot recommend it highly enough!<br/>"

33225888,428216599,,37192766,Elena,"We really had a pleasant stay at Holly and Matt's place. The house is in a nice neighborhood and was centrally located to the places we visited during our stay. <br/>The house is very well appointed. They thought of everything! So glad we didn't have to worry about bringing all the basics with us. There was shampoo, conditioner, body wash and soap in the shower (which is great because I forgot to pack some). They even had extra razors and feminine products, in case you forget to pack those!<br/>The kitchen was also well equipped. They included all the basic cookware and dishes we needed. The best part was the extensive breakfast, coffee and tea offerings. Our boys enjoyed the cereal and muffins in the morning.<br/>We had a busy weekend so we didn't spend much time at the house but kind of wish we had! There are more than enough board games, coloring books, and books to keep you entertained on a relaxing day in.<br/>Our hosts went above and beyond. They seriously thought of everything and included all we could possibly need for a comfortable stay. <br/>Thanks for being some of the best hosts we've had (and we use Airbnb and HomeAway A LOT)! We would not hesitate to recommend this place to our friends and hope to stay again in the future!"

241016,9172694,,3719771,Melissa,I had a wonderful stay! This location is right on the Rapid Ride D and 32 lines. I was easily able to go back and forth to the downtown on the D line as well as Fremont area on the 32. The room was comfortable and warm. I appreciated the space heater and extra blanket the 2nd night as it was really cold in Seattle. I had full access to the kitchen which I didn't end up using and the bathroom was next to my room! Everyone in the house was friendly and it was nice to chat about the area and where I was going. They gave me great recommendations on bookstores too! I would definitely stay here again!

Great value overall. ??"

We took an Uber to California St. to have dinner and then chose to have a nice nighttime stroll back to the house. It was a great walk, looking at the many restaurants and interesting shops that were around. We ended the night with a lengthy chat by the crackling fireplace... perfect! Looking forward to coming back to stay here again in the future for sure...."
17608455,140976884,,3737133,Mycale,"This truly is a hidden gem. Jim and Alice have done a fantastic job setting the apartment up for multiple guests. If you're looking for a quiet and peaceful place to stay while still having easy access to the city or university, this is the perfect place. The warm and welcoming hosts, comfortable bed, well equipped kitchen, and flowers around the property made my stay perfect. So perfect that I'm staying for another 3 weeks. Thanks Alice and Jim for making me feel at home!"

51460382,5.37E+17,,37432910,Mingkeung,"Before looking into this apartment, keep in mind that this is actually a short term rental requiring background check even though you are booking it through Airbnb. <br/>The furnished apartment is nice and clean with amenities in like-new conditions. It's located just outside the downtown area and there's not a lot of shops close by. But you could walk to Whole Foods in about 10 mins. <br/>The main downside is the location of the apartment in the building. It faces the back alley on the lower level. So there's absolutely no view. You cannot even leave the window blinds up since anyone who walks past the alley could see the whole living room. For a short stay (1-2 weeks), this would not be a big problem. But for a minimum stay of 31 nights, some people may not be able to tolerate it."
14166842,90209285,,37458329,Candace,"This was our first time staying at an Airbnb location, and we are so happy that we chose to stay with Cheryl! We arrived on Saturday around 3:30 for a concert in Seattle at 7:30. <br/><br/>We found street parking easily in front of Cheryl's home. We were greeted by Cheryl and her doggies - so adorable! Cheryl showed us our room and let us get settled in. She offered us wine or champagne if we were interested. We were hungry, so she suggested some restaurants within walking distance. <br/><br/>When it was time for the concert, Cheryl offered to drive us there. After the concert, despite it being after midnight, Cheryl also offered to pick us up. She made our stay so easy and really went above and beyond to make sure that we were taken care of.<br/><br/>As for the space itself, it was as described and how it looked in pictures. Cheryl has a very cool home. I wish we had stayed longer so I could admire more of it! <br/><br/>Cheryl was the perfect host. We will absolutely be looking for her place first on our next trip to Seattle. Thanks for making our weekend trip so great, Cheryl!"
50604707,6.74E+17,,37462881,Fabrice,"Tony's place was absolutely amazing. The apartment has everything you might need, even for a longterm stay or when you're working from home. Communication with the host was excellent, and the designated parking spot was a nice bonus. The host even left some gifts for us when we arrived at the place, very thoughtful! :) <br/>Everything was as described in the listing and the view from our balcony was amazing. Would definitely consider staying here again in the future!"
48915924,744751721,,374662367,Dom,"We stayed here with another couple and my parents. It was perfect having the bottom suite for my parents so they could make coffee in their room and go on their early morning walks without disturbing the rest of us. We had sunshine for our entire stay so really appreciated having the grill in a secluded garden space. We were all so impressed with the views on the rooftop, too! We spent every morning and every night up there. The thoughtful guide of Seattle and what to do (or eat) in the area was a nice surprised and got used a lot to help us have a truly memorable stay."

He really go out for people in a respectful way!!

The apartment with view on the lovely house garden was very clean and nicely decorated. Everything needed for a great stay was supplied for by Julia including detailed info on the neighbourhoods hot spots and public transport. The walk to downtown is not long and takes you along good shops, restaurants and coffee cafes. I highly recommend it!"
46219158,728512573,,375686411,James Alex,"I have been hesitant to write an honest review for this BnB, because it’s clear that the people operating it were trying their best just to stay afloat a create a business. <br/>This listing is a shared space with room capacity for 8-10 people (there are 5 bedrooms.) Masks were available but there was no way to “encourage” other guests to be responsible in the space. I was not aware that there would be so many rooms in this BnB prior to booking it, and honestly, it was really scary staying around so many people who clearly did not take the initiative to be COVID safe. Where were they going? What were they doing all day? Were they smart enough to stay safe outside of the home? All I wanted to do was hide in the room, and eventually, I became complacent with my mask-wearing as well. They eventually installed soap dispensers in the bathrooms, but I feel that this was more for the appearance of being safe than actually operating the BnB in a conscientious manner. <br/>I feel strongly that they were irresponsible for creating the BnB space that they did, clearly out of an effort to maximize profit as much as possible, with disregard for the risks involved in housing so many guests. <br/>Yes, it was within our price range and we took the bite because we needed to conserve resources, but this space was quite simply a highly dysfunctional and uncomfortable environment to stay in. <br/>As far as communication goes, the host was extremely passive-aggressive. He sent mass messages as, “To all guests” regarding cleanliness in the shared kitchen space, as there were not enough dishes for other guests to use because they were all dirty. The host supplied four plates for a space that had the capacity for 8-10 people. He later threatened to install cameras in the kitchen to “catch” whoever wasn’t washing their dishes. <br/>We were adults who were paying to stay here and we had to worry about “the watchful eye of big brother” making sure that we were being responsible for how we conducted ourselves in a shared living space. This is absolutely ridiculous. I understand that he was trying to accommodate other guests by enforcing cleanliness standards within the space, but there is no way that I can regard this as clear, effective communication.<br/>I cannot recommend this to anyone, other than somebody who is willing to settle for something that they feel they can afford while compromising the ability to operate on the basis of mutual understanding and respect with the host and other guests."
50417172,6.07E+17,,37600982,Michelle,"What a cute home! Our family of 4 were so comfortable. I didn’t realize that this is a current home (possibly for Andrea’s family?). But that meant it was very well stocked with everything we needed: pillows, blankets, speaker for music, etc. It just felt so cozy. Andrea left use some goodies (juice, wine and chocolate) along with fresh flowers And the kitchen…. Any dish, pot or utensil you might need. The neighborhood was very cute and quiet. Highly recommend!"

We would definitely stay here again."
7581631,45135655,,37629684,Sharon,"William gave us extremely detailed directions and instructions on how to get to and in to his gorgeous little apartment. It was immaculate and well presented. The location is great, a minutes walk from major buses to get you into the Pike Place area and a wonderful coffee shop (quality that Aussies will love) and a great breakfast and lunch place that cater for gluten free. Thank you William for my first AirBnB experience, you have made me very keen to continue to travel this way!"

35937764,566231684,,37853275,Mina,"Thank you so much for hosting us! This was the best AirBnB experience I’ve had! I was in Seattle for a few days and wouldn’t have spent it anywhere else.<br/>Alina’s place was amazing. Newly built, the design is both aesthetic and functional. It’s well-lit and fairly minimalist. <br/>There are individual thermostats throughout the apartment. Sound doesn’t travel very much. <br/>Bedroom: the bed was incredibly comfortable, and that’s rare in Airbnb’s. I slept a lot later than my partner so the bedside lights were ideal for reading. I also slept in because I felt like I was sleeping on a cloud! <br/>Living Room: the couch is so comfortable and cozy! They have a smart tv and it’s logged in to just about every streaming service. The WiFi was on point. <br/>Kitchen: Alina provided filtered water and delicious snacks. The appliances in the kitchen are actually functional and great quality. Alina thought of everything. Also - copper cookware. <br/>Bathroom: Alina has thought of just about everything that you’d need. Their products are all organic. There are exfoliant/scrubs/everything you could need. If you want to draw a bath, Alina provides everything you need to do that. I forgot my slippers and Alina provides soft slippers.<br/>There is easy access to Alki Beach, the freeways, and to various coffee shops. The neighborhood is beautiful to walk through. Street parking is always available right out front. <br/>Alina and Brett respond quickly and they are probably some of the nicest people you will ever meet. They will engage as much or as little as you really want.they have great suggestions for restaurants and bars.<br/>I will definitely be staying at Alina’s place when I have to go back up to Seattle next month. 10/10 recommend!"

This was my first post Covid trip, and it was SO much fun to explore the area. I loved Gas works park, what a beautiful view of the city. The Airbnb itself was so stylish and clean, it made my stay so homey.<br/>Sebastien was super responsive and had a lot of great recommendations for things to do.<br/>Can't wait to stay again!"

36512479,494658629,,38105083,Melissa,"Look no further, you just stumbled upon the best Airbnb experience I have ever had! Georg’s condo is precisely why I prefer Airbnb’s over hotels; it feels like home. Georg very thoughtfully decorated his home to feel both modern and rustic, with a dash of lighthouse. The entire condo is comfortable, well-stocked, and has a beautiful patio to take in the sunset while you look towards Fremont. I appreciated the location, as it is out of the downtown madness. Close enough to everything, yet far enough away that you can relax in a quiet, beautiful condo. It is maybe 1/2 mile from all of the restaurants and coffee shops on Queen Anne, or a quick jaunt over the bridge to Ballard. <br/>Georg was easy to work with; kind and communicated well. He even worked with my very early departure time. I hope to stay here during every Seattle visit I make for now on. :)"
32438199,728627838,,381064224,Jeremy,"4 bunk beds per room, each bed has curtains to draw around it and a locked storage area. Comfortable common areas open twenty four hours. Would definitely stay here again! Fantastic for the value"
6327662,41807207,,38158998,Michael,"This is just as it is described, a very cute little bungalow. Tori was the best host anyone could ask for. We were greeted to our surprise with fresh scones and coffee, as well as milk for the coffee. The space was perfect for our time in Seattle. The bed was comfortable and there was plenty of room for our air mattress, it was well lit and had good air flow once you got the windows opened up. I absolutely loved my stay at Tori's place. I said to her while I was leaving ""that if Airbnb is always like this, I don't ever want to stay in a hotel again,"" and I mean it. This was just a wonderful experience and I hope that all the rest of my stays are just as nice as this was! I have a feeling its going to be difficult to book this place next year."

I would definitely recommend this house."

The location is great - all of the best breweries, bars, and restaurants in Ballard (and in my opinion, the city) are within a mile. If you are looking to get to downtown Seattle, it is just a quick stroll to the bus lines.<br/>The house itself is cozy and sweet. It really captures the Scandinavian fishing theme of the neighborhood. Everything was sparkling clean, with thoughtful amenities throughout. <br/>Renee and Guillermo were very responsive and accommodating. <br/>I will certainly look for this cottage again next time I'm in Seattle!"

45639164,4.15E+17,,38597440,Andrew,"Had some friends from San Diego come up for the weekend and this spot was perfect. Literally a 10 min uber to Pike Place Market & Capitol Hill. Located in a quiet residential neighborhood, we noticed quite a few people walking their dogs and riding their bicycles throughout the evening. The townhome itself is 4 floors, so expect quite a bit of stairs. Three main floors have AC which was nice during the Seattle summer days. The top floor rooftop provided comfortable couches with a skyline view of the city and mountains. One of my friends complimented how fast the wifi was when having to do some last min. work. The airbnb came with 1 designated parking spot in the back but also had plenty of off street parking. I'd also highly recommend the local coffee shop 2 blocks down the street. Appreciate the hospitality Jen Connie and Brian. A+++"

17177425,209949930,,38684485,Danielle,"Colleen's Cottage was just exactly as described, but felt even nicer in person than in the pictures. I was comfortable from the moment I checked in until I left.<br/>*There was prompt and courteous communication and helpful hints about parking and how to access the cottage from a private entry before I even arrived.<br/>*The cottage was in a great location for sight seeing and we could access anywhere in Seattle in about 15 minutes.<br/>*Everything was pristine and really thoughtfully decorated; my favorite part was the little pebble tiles in the bathroom which made the whole place feel a little fairy-tale like.<br/>*There was coffee and fresh cream in the fridge when we arrived and the coffee was GOOD, which was a welcome thing after a lot of driving.<br/>*Wi-fi was easy to access and the signal was great. We didn't watch much tv, but it was nice to be able to turn on Hulu in the tv while we were unwinding in the evening. <br/>* The shower had great water pressure and heat, and there were some bottles of shampoos and conditioner and body wash in case you had forgotten yours. There was also a mini hair dryer as well, which just felt thoughtful. <br/>*There was a full kitchen set up, which came in handy when we wanted to heat up leftovers for breakfast instead of rushing out and it made it so we could have really relaxed mornings to plan out our day.<br/>*The host, Colleen, was really eager to make sure our stay was very pleasant, and while I have always had great experiences with airbnb hosts, this was the best so far. <br/>*I loved that it had a keypad entry so I didn't have to worry about losing or returning a key when we left, which was good, because we had to leave very early in order to catch our flight.<br/>Overall, this was a great place and I would highly recommend."
23293234,418274857,,38691980,Keli,"I had such a wonderful stay at Alice Cottage. Jill and her family were lovely hosts. They made sure to be available if I needed anything, but gave me my privacy as well. <br/>The guest house itself was ideal. The decor was very personal and stylish. You can see how much love and labor went into the build of it. The king size bed was nice and firm, and I feel like your rarely see beds bigger than queens in most air bnbs. <br/>The kitchen was fully stocked with cooking implements, pots, pans, spices, and even baking dishes and accessories. The keurig and electric kettle were especially nice. I loved the little touches like tea selection, stocked coffee pods, fresh flowers on the table, and the compost bags. <br/>With all of the appliances like dishwasher, washer, dryer, and amazing bathroom with soaking tub and multiple shower heads, it really felt like a second home. <br/>I already miss Churchill saying hello<br/>to me everyday :). The location is another major perk. Just a quick walk to NW Market, the heart of Ballard, and many of the metro lines. There is also a cute coffee shop that serves food only a block and a half away. <br/>Hoping to be able to stay at Alice Cottage on a future visit! Thank you again for the great stay!"

The 3-story loft was very large with open windows and had a lot of natural lighting. Lots of beds, great touches to each sleeping space, kitchen was stacked with spices and tools, lots of balconies and the big bathroom was suuuuuuuuper nice and spacious. The roof top was also very cool!! You can see a nice view of downtown Seattle! It was a very modern and cozy stay. Highly recommend!"

The whole check-in and check-out process is very seamless and timely. The house is conveniently located close to the heart of Seattle. Just close enough to the city, without being in the middle of the hustle and bustle. Very pleased with how spacious and clean the home is. More than enough room to accommodate a large family, and still be very comfortable. Highly recommended."

The place was very clean (like, spotless), modern (think it’s a brand new build), had everything I needed to feel at home, and was an easy walk to all the restaurants, coffee shops, bars and stores of Columbia City. The PCC Natural Market grocery store is a mecca for foodies and was the perfect place to stop off after getting off the Link Light Rail to grab great food. The apartment was also really thoughtfully appointed with things like USB charging stations, dimmable lighting, high-quality coffee and tea and an awesome TV. The full size closet was also great to stow away my things. Communication was consistent and reliable too. I would highly recommend this wonderful gem when visiting Seattle!"
49254280,762329806,,390708449,Sam,Great location but otherwise small unit in old building. No parking and literally smells like garbage outside the door. There was a lot of little ants and heater gets way too warm if you turn it on. She had construction done for a few days while I was trying to work and I lost Wi-Fi for a day. She offered me an annual lease for like 1300 while I was paying nearly 1800 for a month.

Perfect location with everything you need, including funky Seattle-style coffee shops, within walking distance. Considerate and intriguing hosts were friendly and helpful all around. We had three AirBnB experiences in Seattle this summer and this was the best by far."
31465446,424411852,,39185638,Jessica,"I could go eons about how incredible my six week stay was at Lea's place. I was her very first guest, and she was nothing but sweet and accommodating. Her unconditional hospitality made her already beautiful home that much better. The reason why I had chosen Lea's Airbnb initially was the private porch and view of the Olympic Mountains. Waking up to the sun peeking over the mountains and watching it set down again once I came home from work is something I will never get over. One thing to note is that the nearest bus stop is 15 minutes walking away. I mainly relied on Uber since I did not have a car. There is a local grocery market about 7 minutes away as well as a quaint cafe and Italian restaurant if you ever find yourself without access to transportation. Other than that, the place was immaculate, comfortable, and one of the reasons why I love Washington. I can't wait to come back to the PNW and stay again."
48684962,743617059,,392292114,Camille,Our stay in their beautiful home was amazing. The view and location were phenomenal! The house is beautiful and very roomy for our large family. We absolutely loved our time here and would definitely stay here again!
46585235,739237629,,392300761,Sabrina,"Great place, very comfortable and the host was extremely accommodating. Highly recommend."
40293561,743226389,,392457248,Abhilash,"Awesome place to live in, the location is pretty nice, the host are pretty chill too. All in all loved the whole thing."
51460263,5.2E+17,,392482354,Bisher,No parking and the heat was not working
39324177,563994015,,39268823,Bea,"This is our 4th time of staying here. The condo is clean & well equipped. The location is great to the stores, bus and downtown."
2298775,11839081,,3929249,Keith,"What an amazing place to stay in Seattle: a rural farm in the city! It's such a joy to walk into this oasis and to leave the hustle and bustle behind you. It is like going back to another, more peaceful era. And the home itself is full of wonderful family history, comfort and simple joy. Lee and Steve are generous and goodnatured hosts, warmhearted and progressively working towards a sustainable future for themselves and their local community. A great source of information about what is truly good about Seattle and Seattlelites."
48569368,753743999,,393347006,Joshua,"Great visit, great price, clean and well laid out house. Deb was great too and I can't stress that enough because you seriously roll the dice with some of these hosts and they can either be bad or good. Deb was fantastic !"
49799303,761812108,,393734341,Charlie,A pretty unique place
52708295,5.41E+17,,394312173,Alejandra,"Nice, cozy place for a couple. Which was perfect for us. Wish is such a great person, she’ll answer you quick if you have any questions. Recommend staying here."
44233827,644013260,,39439805,Kyle,"Great location and space. Brand new apartment complex and has everything you need with beautiful Seattle views. Staff was accommodating and balcony/shared roof was great addition. Clean, functional and minimalism made for a great stay!"
51717921,5.04E+17,,39445956,Samantha,"Clean, warm and great location. Only stayed one night but host was very friendly and helpful."
53155876,5.35E+17,,395310723,Emily,This was a very comfortable apartment and was a short walk from Pikes Place. Host was very easy to communicate with and check in was easy and accommodating. great place to stay in Seattle overall.
4069543,19353648,,3954802,Omar,Karla and Sean were able to set this room last minute and it was perfect! We had a bit more privacy on this room which was good. Great experience staying at their house.
1305895,5550263,,3958882,Bill,"Staying at Nathan's place was comfortable and he was an excellent host, even tossing me a couple of books that were on topic with my project work. If I'd asked I probably could have borrowed a paddle board. 5-8 min from the central freeway. 12-15 min from downtown. High on the list of Air BnB places for return trips."
10773688,65361808,,3963554,Steve,"Awesome place, super easy check in and check out and a very responsive host."
49883276,768426817,,396538041,B,I don't like focusing on negative things(especially when they can impact someone's livelihood) but after the subsequent behavior of the host I'll just say one thing--take lots of photos. And if you have a guest staying with you and they want to take even more photos don't argue with them. Even if it's an annoying amount. They might come in handy.
50362440,4.38E+17,,39655750,Yuwon,Great location
26074454,285831278,,39660016,Julia,"I cannot say enough great things about this place. It is sparkling clean, amazing location, very central, the building is quiet and the check in process was super easy. It exceeded our expectations and we would definitely stay again!!!"
50814675,8.67E+17,,396636550,Allen,"This Condo was exactly as described! <br/> Great location for me within walking distance of both Fremont and Wallingford, with plenty of bars and restaurants nearby. Building is easy to access with keypads, and felt safe at night. <br/> Large patio and live plants around the house as well!"
20942684,222437441,,396675,Ed,"Stephanie really went out of the way to make the stay enjoyable. When I arrived there were flowers, a holiday plant and some nice treats in the refrigerator, making it extra special! She was also very helpful with information about the area, local events and how to get around the Seattle area. <br/>The place is exactly as pictured and described. What you cannot get out of the AirBNB site though is how comfy and cozy the place is. It feels more like a retreat in the country rather than 2 miles from a large city! And her puppy, Maisy, is pretty great too...Would highly recommend this great city retreat to anyone."
49574865,3.86E+17,,39720081,Natasha,Great stay!
21080282,205264092,,3973627,Krystal,"Cute, clean, cozy, quiet, and in a great location! Perfect for our short one-night stay to see a show at the Fremont Abbey. We only wished we had brought our pillows from home, but that's totally a personal preference. A cute garden kitty was there to welcome us, and the chickens bid us farewell. We would definitely stay at Jon & Barb's Seattle Tiny Home again!"
9.53E+17,9.64E+17,,397440125,Jessica,"This place was amazing! Conveniently located ! Cute, little place, walking distance from Pike's Place, shops and restaurants. Palisade was very easy to get a hold & communicate with. I recommend this place to anyone vising Seattle. It is also very close to the Space Needle and it was a Great view of it too. I would definitely stay here again!"
49219256,752168142,,39782044,Chrishelle,Love the communication between the host and myself. Very responsive and welcoming. Five star service!
52708294,6E+17,,398015268,Halimah,nice place nice host
20497066,190670377,,39810277,Patti,"Really nice space with a great view and a perfect location. Everything you need is in walking distance. Apartment is compact, but very clean and comfortable. David went above and beyond to make us feel at home."
48903901,753379596,,398202663,Victor,"Everything was okay, perfect location and great view to the city"
49202931,763136190,,398294111,Paige,"Very receptive to guest needs, love the privacy we were able to get. Also was super helpful that they had a microwave and any other things we needed."
8.99E+17,9.44E+17,,3988276,Ulrich (Uli),"Stayed two nights at Lisa's Airbnb in West Seattle - outstanding experience! Lisa was a superb host, offering fast, beyond friendly communication and clear instructions. The location is nestled in a quiet, safe street. I enjoyed the brand new deck featuring a private hot tub, new bathroom, incredibly comfortable mattress, high-speed internet, and a large TV in my private space with a private entry. The personal touch, including welcoming wine and snacks, truly made me feel at home. Proximity to Starbucks, local coffee shops, restaurants, and Safeway is a plus - all within an easy walk. Notably, during a 5-hour power outage in the entire block (not specific to this Airbnb), Lisa went the extra mile, keeping me updated with real-time information from the Seattle power company and even providing an extra power bank and snacks. Highly recommended, will definitely rebook. Thank you, Lisa!"
3303857,14654958,,3996403,Julien,"Nice flat: clean, calm, spacious and comfortable.<br/>A little far from downtown but located in a quiet place with many buses stops, restaurants and shops. Notice that there is no TV in the flat (but it was not a problem for us).<br/>WIFI was slow during the first day, but Melissa fixed it quickly. <br/>She made checking in and out very easy."
48236463,759353861,,399665527,Julie,"It was a wonderful stay, location was perfect for this trip, it was very comfortable and we felt right at home."
53526366,6.29E+17,,399988926,Elizabeth,A wonderful home! The mattresses were very uncomfortable and could use an upgrade. The double bed in the blue room was the only bed I could sleep on and walk the next day. Which was very unfortunate because the master bedroom backs up to the nature park behind the home. It was so peaceful and serene. Everything you could want or need was provided in this home away from home. We were the very first guests so there wasn't a guide book for things like a warning when trash or yard maintenance days were. We also didn't have any communication with the host until the day before checkout. Overall we were very blessed to have found such a gem and thoroughly enjoyed our time in this lovely West Seattle home.
20034739,223814697,,40067875,Mike,"The room was in a perfect location for where we wanted to be. Perry sent a super informative email. We checked in and unfortunately never saw her but since her communication was so great, we had no problems getting into the house. Everything was clean and ready to go."
11601374,64748529,,40082338,Tia,"Coziest location ever, perfect for a little weekend hideaway. Place was clean and presentable. Host went out of his way to make sure we were comfortable. Will definitely be back."
49054458,758127240,,400923243,Melaina,"This location was incredible! The beach is barely a block away. I visited early May; the weather was beautiful and sunsets were a sight to behold. The space was clean and tidy and the host so friendly! The room is small, so it is perfect for a solo trip. I had so much fun being able to explore the beach and local businesses all day, and then come back at night to shower, rest, and repeat! <br/>I would return here and recommended it to anyone looking to get some time to themselves. Its the perfect simple and relaxing mini-getaway."
48917940,765726060,,401432623,Alan,"This is a very nice, quiet and convenient 2br condo, that was relatively new on the market, and our first AirBNB. It exceeded our expectations in all respects. It was close to all necessary shops and Hiways. Our hosts were quick to respond to our questions, and to our requests for needed kitchen tools. Our young granddaughters stayed with us while their parents packed to move, and the condo was quite fine for them. Great place & hosts!!"
5067177,42940507,,40147011,Julian,"The house felt just like your standard Ann Arbor building, so I felt right at home. Everything was clean, the instructions were clear, and everything went smoothly even though I never saw any of the hosts (which is fine). Having walked the town, now, I wouldn't mind the distance and staying at Crayola Home, their other property.<br/><br/>They are very kind in leaving food for guests in the fridge, including an Angry Orchard or two. It was just what I needed, late at night. Some instant Thai ramen was available that just about saved me after finally making it home from the bars at 3:00.<br/><br/>The neighborhood is a tiny San Francisco, which probably appeals more to some than to others.<br/><br/>I would happily stay here again, no matter the situation. Can't beat the price and the location."
49616842,759356484,,401495861,Mandy,Very cozy
53615320,6.78E+17,,401638558,Jacob,The wonderful host provided a friendly welcome to the Manor and made sure our visit was well worth it. The place was in a great location and the room was very cozy and peaceful. Would recommend to anyone staying in the area.
8.12E+17,8.15E+17,,401641354,Cameron,Super friendly and communicative
27683974,3.99E+17,,40233160,Lindsey,"Quiet and serene, lots of beautiful plants to admire in the yard. Christopher’s place is spotless, modern, and charming. I wouldn’t hesitate to stay here again!"
17463195,163951658,,40245743,Zhenyi,Great garden and nice host. It is close to a great shopping mall called university village. The community is very safe and I will choose it next time
7.31E+17,7.4E+17,,402739878,Willis,"Functional location in Capital Hill. Unit was dated, but clean. Laundry was a plus.<br/>Bakery Neuveux (amazing croissants, pastries, sandwiches) and a Safeway, just 3 or so block up the road. <br/>Pull-out couch/bed non-fuctional for anyone over 40"" - would be sufficient for a very small kid, maybe.<br/>A reasonable place to stay for 2 people."
7646637,42062596,,40275347,Ralph,"We made this booking at the last minute, about a week before our trip to Seattle. Davis was very responsive to our questions before the visit. He was welcoming and helpful when we arrived, suggesting things roun Fremont that we could do. he also made sure that his home would accommodate us and our three teenage children, cringing in comfortable beds for the kids. We all enjoyed our stay very much. David even offered to wash some of our clothes (which we did not need). I needed to see a doctor on the night of our arrival and David pointed me towards the local hospital. We asked for a shower mat at one pojnt and he provided one instantly. In all, this was a great start to our vacation in Seattle and we'd stay again without hesitation."
19149347,159855871,,40290332,Valerie,"Melissa was a fantastic host. She was very accommodating and went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed. The location was perfect for our stay, as we were attending a graduation at UW. The condo is within walking distance to the stadium. Melissa was available whenever we needed her and offered suggestions of places to eat in the area."
21598019,212215204,,4029923,Jessica,"This cozy house is in a fantastic location, with a great view and easy walking distance to restaurants, coffee shops, and a cute music bar down the street. We had a lovely time! Eric was very hospitable and made some great recommendations. Thank you!"
23702214,283380764,,40317654,Corry,"Overall the property was okay. I’d say a pretty good option for groups of 4-6. <br/>There is a 2 car garage that is shared with the neighbors. It’s difficult to park there and we were asked by the host to move to the street. Once we got used to the best practices of parking in the space it was okay. Definitely not ideal. Street parking is pretty solid, so overall it worked out.<br/>Communication was pretty good but there was a clear lack of attention to detail.<br/>Home was nice, clean, etc. biggest complaint was lack of central AC and uncomfortable beds. Internet was also pretty bad. Lots of stairs, which isn’t a complaint but noteworthy. There is a window AC in the master bedroom and in the living area. It’s a big home though so just something to be aware of if renting in the summer months.<br/>Location is nice.<br/>Price was a little high for what we got. I’d say 3.5/5 overall."
17962405,153755735,,403480,Heather,"We were Michael's first Airbnb guests and he did a fabulous job. We had everything we needed to have an enjoyable stay. My group of friends and I had a delightful time. The house is comfortable and well equipped with everything you would need. This is the perfect place to stay if you are looking for a quiet weekend away and don't want to be in the bustling city of Seattle. West Seattle is super chill and the location of the house is very quiet and residential.<br/>Michael was easy to communicate with and greeted us on arrival so we could get the full tour of the listing. He has a detailed guidebook that will give you all the information you need to have a comfortable stay.<br/>Alki Beach is a short walk away, and we took advantage of all the amazing food nearby. There are so many options! We ate at Cactus, Top Pot, and Alki Cafe. All were great places to eat. There is a free shuttle stop half a block away that will take you directly to the Water Taxi terminal for easy access to downtown Seattle.<br/>Honestly, I wish we could have stayed longer because I felt like there was so much more we could have done. Alki Beach has views of the Olympic Mountains to the West, Mt. Baker to the Northeast and the North Cascades just to the East. <br/>I hope to stay here again in the future, though I fear more people will see how amazing this place is and it will be solidly booked!"
748526,2981540,,4036135,Michel,"Amy and Milo (her little French Bulldog) were great hosts to us and our dog Libby. The apartment is newly finished and very well appointed. We expected lots of takeout while we rented here but ended up cooking most nights in the small, but practical, kitchen (bonus points for soft-close drawers, yay!). <br/>The bathroom is equally practical with nice finishes, plenty hot water and a shower that I can stand up under which is rare even in most homes.<br/><br/>In short, we had a great stay and I would recommend her and her place to anyone! Thanks again Amy!"
6.65E+17,6.8E+17,,403724903,Alexandra,"The location couldn't be better for visiting Belltown. So very close to things Amazon, the monorail, South Lake Union and more. Donuts right next door. Eating options in every walkable direction. This is a dream space, really a pied-à- terre feel. The subterranean space means the windows are nearly clerestory, or at the top of the room. This gives great light to the space, and a cozy feel. The street can be lively, but never too busy. The corner of Blanchard and 5th is a good place to be."
53299952,7.19E+17,,403897532,Mariana,"The private space was perfect. It is on par with excellent Airbnb options around the world. You have a space all to yourself, with all the privacy of an apartment. As hostesses they always kept communication open to answer questions that arose during the stay. I highly recommend the space! Good location (if you have a car) very cozy and with everything you need for a good stay. I highly recommend."
6.92E+17,7.36E+17,,40472106,Diane,Location was great. Just outside of the city and very comfortable. Farren did a great job communicating in a timely manner and was super helpful with the check in process. Super clean and cozy! Would highly recommend and would stay again!
53173086,9.13E+17,,404750495,Sarah,"My mother-in-law stayed at Sherry's cottage during a visit to Seattle. (We live in Seattle) We were happy to find such a lovely place for her to stay at near our home. Everything was really great, and then when one unexpected thing did pop up, we felt like Sherry took care of it with speed, grace, and flexibility. I think it's important to know how hosts respond when something small but significant, and totally out of their control pops up. Sherry was stellar. She helped us out in ways that we appreciate, and that turned our weekend around. I can tell she cares a great deal about her property, and goes out of her way to provide an excellent experience for her guests. I would absolutely recommend Sherry as a host. My mother-in-law said that the place had everything she wanted, and she thought it looked very nice. Since I was the one who communicated with Sherry I can vouch for her extreme responsiveness and deeps commitment. Thank you Sherry!!"
7718139,41563591,,40480307,Kyle,"We came into Seattle later than expected and needed a place to stay for the night. We got in touch with Perry at the last minute and he replied right away and had everything ready for us when we got to his place. The tent was set up very nicely with a comfortable air mattress, sleeping bags, pillows and a blanket. The outdoor bathroom was a nice touch and although we didn't use the hot tub, it seemed great! We're definitely happy we stayed with Perry."
52226418,4.72E+17,,405011621,Liezel,"My stay was wonderful. The place was clean and nicely equipped, esp with a generous amount of towels. I also love how the airbnb host provided very comfy indoor slippers, since no outdoor shoes are allowed. However, if you decide to bring a car, you could park on the street, but there is very limited space to park. But you could definitely park in the garage as well, only if your car is as big as a compact suv, but even so, it's still a tight place to park. But hey I guess that's Seattle for you! Otherwise my stay was great!"
49710948,770204162,,405238153,Aimee,Cute and cozy. There is a shared bathroom but it wasn’t any trouble. We never ran into the other guest staying there. The private entrance is great. Enjoyed that it was a bit hidden. Tyler was very welcoming.
19213509,163921625,,40637002,Melanie,"This was a great location for exploring the tourist sites in Seattle while being a little bit away from the busy city. We had our own car and could get to the tourist sites in about 15 minutes during non-peak traffic. <br/>The house was beautifully decorated and very comfortable. The house is well laid out and there is storage space in each of the rooms. Even though we were in the house during a heat wave, the inside of the house was comfortable with a fan running. The kitchen was well stocked with the basic necessities for cooking including spices, sugar, coffee, tea and more. The bathroom had everything we needed and some extra items in case we forgot something. We felt safe in the house and walking around the neighborhood in the evening. Tarah was a great host and quickly responded to our questions."
46619863,744397266,,40649230,Don,"This unit is in a great location and has well thought amenities with an excellent host. It was very clean upon arrival and check-in/out was easy. Communication could not be better, Don is easy to get in-touch with. <br/>One item to note is that noise transmission from the upstairs unit is considerable. If you’re concerned about the highway nearby, it is hardly audible and a huge time-saver if you want to get around.<br/>If you like Thai food, Amazing Thai Cuisine around the corner is a great spot to walk to. In general there is a good amount of restaurants and stores within walking distance.<br/>We enjoyed our stay as it felt like home."
9887142,65182684,,4072846,Greg,"Maureen was a very attentive hostess. I was in Seattle on an intense business trip, so I was out the door early in the morning and back late in the evening. However, there were nice teas and coffees and little snacks available if I wanted them and notes about what to do with dishes, etc. The guest accommodation part of the home is extremely clean and spacious (two bedrooms, a private bathroom, living room, exercise equipment, kitchenette and a great library!) The location is in a quiet area doors away from a park, but there are restaurants and grocery stores a few blocks away. Since I was on the downstairs level, I was concerned about noise overhead, but it was very quiet during my sleeping hours. (And an added bonus, much less airplane noise than in most parts of central Seattle!)"
12931310,74547509,,40806777,Daisy,"I can't say enough good things about Debby's listing! Loved staying here! She and her family were incredibly warm and welcoming. I had the independence to come and go when I needed to and operate separately, as well as feeling like I could socialize and talk to Debby and her husband when I wanted to. The space itself was beautiful, very spacious - the basement felt like my own little apartment. Debby left amenities out so I had everything I needed. Great value. I actually wish I had been staying longer, as it was such a nice space to relax, work and recuperate!"
29877836,479393773,,40816735,Sandra,"Great location, clean as a whistle, comfortable. We had a great time."
49196210,4E+17,,40832719,Campbell,"A great stay! Lisa’s house is fabulous, and she was a great communicator. Lots of nice, small touches - a welcome note, a bottle of wine, candies, flowers picked from the garden, and more. The house itself is beautiful and spacious. We loved the back patio, too! Would highly recommend and return. Thank you for a lovely stay!"
32595122,435151169,,40833031,Eliza,"Blair was so professional to work with and went above and beyond to make sure I was happy. I had to cancel last minute due to a family illness, and Blair worked with Airbnb to refund my payment, which was very considerate. Now I understand why they call him a Superhost!"
43110115,703353374,,40915623,Dan,Great location! Aland was very responsive! We enjoyed our stay.
22512175,267805727,,4095416,Randy,"Huge! A full-sized living room with an L-shaped couch, a dining table, full kitchen (except no conventional oven), and large bedroom make this a palace in Seattle. No hotel suite can compare for space. A 2018 renovation left it beautifully decorated, furnished, and finished. It was perfectly clean. <br/>The proximity to local markets, cafés, restaurants, and parks on foot make this a great place to be without a car, and downtown Seattle is easy to get to by public transit, car, or bicycle. <br/>For guests over 6 foot tall (185 cms), some of the doorways are low and you’ll need to duck slightly to get through. The ceiling height is close to 7 feet, so fine for most anyone. <br/>The highway that makes this location easy to get to (Rt 520) also contributes to a very low droning sound in the distance, which is only really apparent outside the house but could still be heard inside when sitting inside quietly. Otherwise the neighborhood is quiet. <br/>The host is well-organized, friendly, easy to communicate with, and attentive. <br/>This place is a gem in Seattle, and the exquisite restoration of this grand, heritage-era home makes it a treat to arrive and stay there."
41102707,7.14E+17,,41015447,Deborah,"I have to say, the view from this house is really nice. Overlook to Lake Washington from the Patio is fantastic. <br/>However, my whole stay was screwed up by the guests/tenants who do not follow house rules. When I got in, the kitchen counter was full of food scrapes and ANTS - yes, ants everywhere, including on the floor. <br/>There are products to repel ants so the problem has been there for a while. The main reason is people live there do not clean up and left the mess and dirty dishes on the counter and in the sink for a long time.<br/>The toilet was dirty too. Someone sprayed on the rim and didn't clean up - it's disgusting. After following the host's instruction, I wrote the issue on the whiteboard in kitchen. Seems ""clean up your own mess"" message works!! <br/> I wouldn't blame this on the host as she has been very responsive every time I raised up the issues. I guess when you want to save some cost on living, these are what you get. If you are a super clean person, maybe to reconsider when booking this one."
7800143,42633672,,41120188,Leonda,"We were simply desperate to find a place for three nights to sleep our entire family. Our host was so prompt at returning her emails and we were able to secure a reservation in a short period of time. She was so welcoming and friendly, and made us feel right at home immediately. <br/>The cupboards and drawers were filled with everything we could possibly need and the beds were comfortable and versatile for our whole family. The neighborhood was very west Seattle and we were so comfortable with the setting, even a very friendly outdoor cat that would inspire us to peek under the bushes to see her snoozing in the shade. Bathrooms were nice, everything was very clean, and a sweet little garden area on the side of the house for sitting outside was a plus. The location was so easy to get to and from the downtown area or onto the west Seattle bridge to Seattle. We will definitely use it again."

22656833,278271806,,4113814,Phil,I booked this place for some friends who were visiting. It's a really nice house and they loved their stay. Hugo was a great host.
10362672,62596170,,4114654,Joe,Margaret's place was great! Quiet neighbor and close walk to coffee shops and Capitol Hill.
7810447,42989944,,41197241,Kurtis,The listing is accurate. No complaints from me at all. Everything you need is within walking distance. Michelle is an accommodating host. I would definitely stay here again.
10280132,66613241,,41205347,Paul,"Thank you Ron and Nancy for opening your home to us! We really enjoyed the adorable, cozy and comfortable accommodation. We especially liked being within walking distance to the zoo as well as an outstanding market. The private entrance and ease of parking was appreciated. Thank you for the thoughtful touches of decor, wine, and coffee press. We enjoyed hanging out in the space with the fireplace on sipping coffee in the morning and wine in the evening. Thank you again so very much."
24210756,277588449,,41219117,Jamie,"Nothing but wonderful things to say about Lisa's lakefront apartment! I truly felt like I was staying in a resort town for the 6 weeks I was in the area. The condo itself has everything you could possible need. The kitchen is fully stocked with kitchen ware and cooking utensils. The dinning area and living space was an absolute treat to come home to after work every day (pictures are a great representation of the space). And the bedroom is a personal oasis with a cute bathroom to match. Great water pressure in the shower and lots of closet/drawer space was an added bonus! The community of Leschi was absolutely wonderful. I felt very safe and would walk down to the park/water area daily. Less than ten minutes away is the Leschi market, an adorable neighborhood grocery store, as well as a Starbucks and several nice restaurants. Parking space was great if you have a car, but commuting downtown is a breeze! The 27 bus takes you straight to the doors of Harborview medical center and directly downtown. Runs frequently with several stops in the neighborhood, including one just a few steps down from the apartment (approx. 3 minute walk from front door to bus stop!) The apartment also has several wonderful amenities, including an amazing pool area. Neighbors are friendly and community is quaint and quiet. Lisa and her husband Steve are also great hosts and were available if I ever needed anything. They were extremely responsive to any questions I had, whether it was pre-arrival or during the duration of my stay. It was clear they wanted to make my stay as comfortable as possible and the attention to detail in the apartment itself was a clear representation of that. I would absolutely recommend this airbnb to any and all and it will certainly be on the top of my list the next time I am in Seattle."
24607657,273299739,,4123160,Kevin,"Of the six I’ve stayed in in Seattle, this has by far been the best air bnb. Clean, all the amenities you expect in business travel. By the water. Outdoor seating. Super comfortable bed. You get some exercise but really, it’s a great location. Lyft’s no problem. Lime bikes everywhere. Will book again."
22495021,261704453,,4129144,Lisa,"I enjoyed staying in this comfortable, attractive room at Andrew’s house. Though it is one room in their family home, it was very private since they primarily use the upstairs spaces. <br/>The neighborhood is quiet, pretty and just steps from the most popular park in Seattle-Green Lake. There are restaurants and other amenities within a short walk. I think anyone would love staying here as much as I did!"
49180183,755915028,,41292925,Max,Great spot for a couple or a small group.
15955405,132930825,,41304061,Tom,"Stunning location with a priceless view of the skyline. Thoughtfully appointed with high quality bedding and linens, this apartment was top shelf through and through. A simple kitchen had everything needed for our stay. The finishes were well chosen. It's a very urbane and comfortable retreat in an excellent location. Our hosts were every bit as good as the space. Clear and fast communicators who made us feel very welcome. An exceptional property."
12170734,77016356,,41329275,Tony,Gorgeous house!!! It was great for our group and we were all relaxed. And our host was great!

5989276,6.83E+17,,413534984,Gwen,Our daughter was in Seattle for a summer internship.<br/> “Kristi was very accommodating and had the perfect apartment set up for a month long stay.”
11356904,71497149,,4137997,Suzanne,"We have stayed at The Maple several times and always stay there if there is an available apartment. It is a great location on Capitol Hill, walking distance to the activities on Broadway or 15th, each easily accessible. It is also just a few blocks from several bus lines on John St. as well as the new rapid transit which you can take all the way from the airport. The apartments are spacious one bedrooms, well furnished and an equipped kitchen, nice hardwood floors. It has always been very clean with no trace of previous occupants. Highly recommended!"
49251550,754824026,,41395417,Von,Great location for International District and you're within walking distance to all the sporting venues.
48714803,757145689,,41431805,Meeka And Tony,"Great location, incredible view, and very communicative and helpful host. Would highly recommend!"
50227353,8.71E+17,,414411153,Denis,"We absolutely loved it here! The place is well equipped, renovated and has everything you need. The beds were comfortable, the home is very clean and spacious. Amazing location right next to the C line bus stop and Lincoln Park! The hosts were attentive and accommodating. I highly recommend staying here!"
53532070,9.91E+17,,414923821,Carl,The house was really nice and the host were Amazing! Would recommend to anyone
31219741,411799475,,41502079,Theresa,Super-nice hosts! Fantastic communication and really care that their guest are comfortable. A designated parking space just outside the door is a rare find in this popular neighborhood! Greatly appreciated! :)
50269759,4.57E+17,,415448174,Robert,"Excellent home, just as pictured. The location is close to all the great food & retail shops in Ballard. Mark was an excellent host; he maintained prompt and clear contact throughout the experience."
48741249,755400902,,41668765,Brock,"Rachel and Nic were absolutely wonderful hosts during our month long stay. They were very thoughtful and attentive to everything we needed.<br/>The apartment is great and has everything you need - well stocked and organized. The location is AMAZING - right in the heart of Columbia City neighborhood which is a must if visiting Seattle. <br/>We highly recommend staying with Rachel & Nic in Columbia City - we can't say enough good things about them, the apartment, and the location."
14696993,99698526,,41677360,Jeannette,"Beautiful, clean detached studio in a cute and quiet neighborhood just minutes from downtown Seattle. Lucy was super helpful while also giving us plenty of privacy. We felt completely comfortable with all the amenities of home, great place to stay. Would definitely recommend this Airbnb to other guests!"
51350294,5.16E+17,,417239465,Lonna,"We were privileged to stay in this Airbnb for three months during a relocation to Seattle. Our memories of the location, the rooftop views of Seattle, the amenities, and the always prompt attention of our host will be our takeaways. We highly recommend this location for a short or long-term stay. We will be very pleased to stay here again or to rent it for our guests."
6694276,61111153,,41731731,Mary,"A lovely place to stay. Three of us came up for a funeral and found a peaceful retreat. A wonderful family greeted us with smiles and a very large polar bear. Interesting pet! The beds were very comfortable and everything was neat, clean and brand new! What a pleasure to be the first folks to stay here. So many delightful restaurants close by! Staying here allowed us to immerse ourselves in the charming West Seattle atmosphere. Wish we could stay longer. Thank you for a wonderful home away from home!"
52845143,5.85E+17,,417394731,Daniel,Perfect location with tons of room and great amenities. 10 out of 10! Would recommend for SPU students.
24393004,256818943,,41819039,Robel,"This space is really lovely, very clean and stylish. The master bedroom is very spacious. So are the bathrooms; very clean and water was warm and with appropriate pressure. This place was very comfortable for four of us. The amenities were ????. The fridge was full with ground coffee, a bottle of rose, and more. There was even fruits on the kitchen counter for us to enjoy. <br/>If you are in town for a convention(like us ), this is the most conveniently located place one could wish for. We walked to the convention center every day. We could see what was happening inside the convention center from our bed. Literally. <br/>Siena was a wonderful host. She interacts mostly through a text, but she was quick to respond. All the time. <br/>This is really a great spot. My partners were already talking about booking it for the next year. One inconvenience if I have to mention, it would be the way heat was controlled in the building. At the time we were there, it was unseasonably warm; however, the building management hadn’t yet turned off the heat. Heat is controlled by the building, but AC is controlled within unit. So we had to leave windows open for cool air to come in. It wasn’t a big deal for us."
24734607,295081420,,41828259,Cristen,"We stayed here for two nights and did enjoy the space. There were a few things we were disappointed about, though. <br/>We never received the WiFi code (stated to be on a card in the studio but nowhere to be found). I messaged the host but never received a response. <br/>A coffee-maker is listed as an amenity but was not available, so expect to get coffee elsewhere. A dishwasher is also listed but not available (not necessary for us but the listing is inaccurate). <br/>There is a door with glass panels that leads to the shared laundry area. This door locks and has a curtain over the glass but one of the panels near the doorknob is missing - this made me feel insecure as other tenants were in the house. There is potential for someone to reach in and unlock the door. The laundry was also unavailable to us as the other tenants were using it constantly. Not the hosts fault, though. <br/>Other than that, there is a private entrance from the outside and the space is a finished basement in the home. It’s a nice short-term space for a couple, in a nice neighborhood and 15 minutes from downtown Seattle."
11237991,5.97E+17,,41844461,Rose,"This studio apartment is quite roomy for a ""studio"". Plenty of closet space, full kitchen, and a very comfortable bed. I also felt my car was in a safe place. It's very private on a dead end road."
7178239,45861351,,41931522,Chia-Yu,Here is really a good place to stay~ it's really comfortable and clean !<br/>Sherry is very friendly and nice;)<br/>I love here a lot ;)
47406405,724999471,,41944686,Pranav,Really enjoyed the stay here. Great location close enough to the city but in a safe location. All the rooms had everything you’d need. <br/>Could make a few additions to the house manuals but that was made up by Their quick responses whenever I had a question. <br/>Definitely would stay again if I visit Seattle.
7952930,44073097,,41951247,Jeremiah,"Space worked out great for our family. We were a couple with kids and the extra space vs a hotel was welcome. Place was clean and well appointed. Nice kitchen with full fridge, stove, microwave, coffee maker, etc. They left out coffee and cookies for us which was nice touch. Living room with couch with TV with Netflix and table with 4 chairs. Carpet is not perfect, but overall place was clean. There is toys on the shelves for kids to play with which was nice for us.<br/><br/>Bed was comfortable and clean. They set up inflatable mattress and porta-crib for our kids which was great. <br/><br/>Bathroom was clean and towels were nice and soft.<br/><br/>Location is quiet on side street with designated off street gravel parking space. Short walk down side of house to back yard. Back yard was nice with a swing, kid's playhouse, and patio furniture. <br/><br/>Two potential negatives:<br/>1. Walk down to back yard could be a problem for someone who is mobility challenged. Not an issue for us, but if this is a concern for you probably not the best location.<br/><br/>2. There is some musty smell. It is a basement apartment in Seattle, so this is to be expected, but if you are sensitive to this it could be a problem. We opened windows and it was less noticeable each day.<br/><br/>Besides that, we enjoyed our stay. Location is nice and quiet and close to I-5 which let's you get around town quickly. Family lives upstairs, but is quiet and respectful."
9.37E+17,9.82E+17,,420269,Izabella,Great host and great location! <br/>Everything you need to feel yourself home and on a vacation at the same time!
42902065,623365327,,4206764,Jessica,"We stay at Claire's & Graham's place for an entire month and could not be happier! Amazing location (Safeway 5 minutes walk, Arboretum 15 minutes walk), incredibly well designed home with lots of really useful touches. The bathroom is spacious, the King bed is amazing. This is an ideal apartment for short as well as long stays. Our toddler enjoyed playing in the backyard! <br/>We would love to come back and highly recommend this apartment."
45134889,4.69E+17,,420755745,David,"I had a great four week stay at this property. It's very modern and well equipped . The open floor plan is perfect, and there's a nice space for a computer/study. The building is connected to a hotel next door, with a nice gym. You couldn't be much closer to the Pike Place Market. Easy walking to everything."
20379370,4.75E+17,,420986337,Lisa,"This is a special, lovely cottage. Laree was a terrific host. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay, and would definitely come back again. Seward park is a charming neighborhood, full of old world charm."
17427868,160839198,,42174219,Zack,very nice place for short or long-term stay. The host's response is fast. She is also very friendly.
16000623,126661632,,42227570,Deb,"Michael's suite no. 4 was well appointed with everything we needed for our 3 day visit to Seattle. The space was clean, comfortable and centrally located to downtown. There were shops close by for grocery shopping. It felt to be a very safe community!<br/>It was easy to get there and access was also very easy. Michael was able to give us early entrance to the suite which was very much appreciated since I had just returned from 24 hours of travel back from India.<br/>Thanks for everything Michael. I would definitely stay there again.<br/>Deb and Tim"
50103542,5.09E+17,,42291429,Curtis,Absolutely amazing place to stay and enjoy the awesome Belltown neighborhood in Seattle. Beautiful and modern condo right in the heart of the city! The hosts thought of everything to make the stay comfortable and hassle-free. Will definitely visit again!
44046825,704296465,,42293446,Alex,It’s a 5 star place highly recommended it’s close to everything in Seattle
37745352,519530998,,42330085,Niki,"This place was Fantastic!! The Fremont / Wallingford area has so much to offer. We walked, to parks, breweries, karaoke and restaurants. Rented Bikes and road to the University district, hit up a brew house (Burke Gilman) and Ubered back with little expense. Downtown is so close and easy to access with lyft or Uber, Or just enjoy the amazing view of the city day or night from Gas Works Park - AMAZING. LOTS of cool unique restaurants and brew houses in both areas that are within walking distance. Fremont brewery, Freemont dock, The triangle, Fish and chips, Mexican, Pams kitchen and Murphys (live music) to name a few. The cottage had everything we needed and more. The back cozy garden area is perfect for morning coffee or relaxing in the afternoon. Jen was a very helpful, available and had the placed set up perfect for us. Thank you so much for the breakfast treats, coffee and little touches. Much appreciated! We will definitely be back, best weekend of the summer."
52402978,4.66E+17,,424294738,Zachary,"This is a nice little condo, centrally located. It's close to downtown, but it's on a residential block away from the nightlife noise. Nice touches like a curved shower curtain rod and a good shower head. <br/>Tommy provides keyless entry, so you don't have to coordinate picking up and dropping off the key.<br/>Fair warning, there are quiet hours, so this is not the place to book if you want to throw a party. But if you want a whole condo with a kitchen, laundry machines, etc. for the price of a hotel room, minus the BS ""resort fees"" and all, this is a great option. I lived in Seattle for 16 years, and this was my first visit back after moving away. I'll most likely look here first for future visits."
21699076,238437155,,4245500,Katherine,Amazing place and location! Bill and Jimi are the friendliest hosts ever. Great amenities and well stocked house just a few blocks from pike place market. Thanks!!
8029177,45205915,,42511815,Joseph,"Jonelle was very sweet and accommodating. We didn't interact much, but that's ok because we were both busy. The ADU is very, very nice! It was beautifully appointed and well maintained. I highly recommend staying with Jonelle if you get a chance!"
24263787,480911014,,42607491,Sanjay,"Ed and Helene are wonderful , and helpful host.<br/>Unit is really clean and accurate as mentioned in pictures , near to transporation , restaurant , cafe etc.<br/>On top of this they have small garden of strawberries and rasberries which i enjoyed alot every day. <br/>i would highly recommend this unit."
8E+17,8.1E+17,,426687782,Roger,I usually do not book no reviewed places but decided to give it a try.<br/>.Place is brand new. The bedroom and bathroom is practically a hotel; definitely better than some I have been in! <br/>Complementary soap and shampoo on a elegant display.<br/>Host Kyle was very responsive and provided me with clear instructions. Easy to find and enter with no issues. Gave local recommendations to transit and restaurants locally.<br/>I definitely recommend Kyle! 5 stars!
1142010,7.34E+17,,427799980,Matthew,Staying at Carla’s was great! The place was clean and everything was outlined where it should be. Her place was eclectic and well decorated! Also it was in an awesome location close to Downtown but far enough away to enjoy other things greater Seattle has to offer. I would definitely recommend staying at Carla’s and I would again if I’m in the area!
51435839,8.65E+17,,428834964,Ali,I’m more then happy that I got to stayed in that place absolutely loved it with my family sadly had to leave early but over all it was a great place to stay in definitely recommend it 10/10 and the host was great
1112092,4439629,,4288875,Christine,"Wonderful time staying in the cottage and Anne and Peter were the perfect hosts! Anne contacted me prior to the trip to ask if we had any special requests, and then checked in while we were there to make sure we had everything we needed (which we did). <br/><br/>The cottage is lovely and immaculately clean! It is bright and open and very quiet. This was a combo work/play trip for me so it was a great place to get work done-- there is a little office area with wireless that worked perfectly for me. There are 2 options for sleeping: a pull out couch in the living area, and a loft upstairs. We chose to sleep in the loft and were very comfortable. There is a ladder that you climb to get up to it... Anne told us about it in advance and it was actually no problem to navigate and get up & down. We thought it was fun. But if anyone has any problems with weight bearing, or vertigo and doesn't want to climb the ladder to the loft, you can sleep in the living area on the pull-out. (Anne was kind enough to ask us our preference prior to the trip.) <br/><br/>My two favorite things about the cottage: 1) Stepping on to beautiful WARM tile floors in the bathroom (I didnt see a heater so I still have no idea how they were heated but it was so NICE-- especially in the morning!) and 2) Hand made avocado soap from Florence, Italy... Lovely! (And it smelled good too.) <br/><br/>We will def come back! <br/><br/>"
1983713,12024155,,4289562,Katherine,"Thank you Scott for your kind words, we would love to stay in touch.<br/>I didn't know we got reviewed as well?? hahah ...<br/>This too was out first time using AirBnB, we have heard so much about it from friends that finally we tied it out. <br/>Scott was a great first host. Loving this personal care, trust and sharing I must say. <br/>Scotts little place is great….Located on a lovely street, close to a bus stop that has the most stunning views over Lake Washington.... Loved it the moment I walked in… for something as small it felt spacious as there are french doors opening out onto a private patio… which gets the sunshine, when it shines, with a natural tree view and squirrels to watch as they play. The fire pit was tempting but the rain kind of didn't support that idea, next cool season however, whoever gets that chance will love it.<br/>The kitchen was brilliantly equipped, except for a kettle ??!! I was able to cook anything I fancied.. and i did. top notch. I luckily brought my own kettle with me as I love my cup of tea and so I was set. I do recommend Scott for you to perhaps get a kettle for those English or Canadian guests who love their tea. <br/>The bed was comfy….careful of your shins on the corners though when walking around the bed… we both got it. The shower was great too… ..all in all we really enjoyed our stay…thank you Scott, you were personable, friendly and helpful where needed. We would have stayed on longer if it had been free, alas others booked it up.<br/>Yes we would highly recommend this lovely private place to stay when visiting Seattle."
50977117,6.03E+17,,429324680,Kimberly,Tali was a great host! Always responded in a timely manner. The apartment was nice. The building could use some upgrades and sprucing up but that is beyond the host’s control. Noise levels are a little too loud sometimes but it is the city and also not something anyone can control. Good shopping nearby including grocery stores. Overall a good place.
48315310,748055971,,4293470,Erin,"Location is great - down the street from a bakery, grocery store, and coffee shop plus more a few blocks away. The house is cute - perfect for a couple or 2 individuals. Karen, the property manager, was super responsive and very helpful. Great small touches, like Macrina cookies, coffee, waters, and snacks waiting for us upon arrival. My husband enjoyed sipping his morning coffee on the front porch."
38077704,575857326,,42936181,Amanda Jo,"Grant and Raymond’s air bnb was definitely one of the best air bnb experiences I’ve had. Everything in their space was high end and all the details were throughly thought out. They communicated quickly and access to the space was easy. The apartment is perfect for short term stays and long term stays, everything you need is there! They stock the place well with cleaning supplies for any messes made. I came from the east coast for a 3 month work trip, being here over Thanksgiving the kitchen was fully equipped to cook a large holiday meal. Fireplace is an added bonus for the cold rainy nights. The apartment building is quiet and it’s easy to get a good nights sleep because the space is so comfortable. West Seattle is a great SAFE area, a few restaurants, coffee shops, and bars within walking distance to the apartment. There are also plenty of grocery stores to walk to. My favorite thing was the farmers market down the street every Sunday with tons of local Washington goodies. I would absolutely stay with Grant and Raymond again, they are wonderful hosts and very accommodating."
27287682,301766986,,4308645,Drew,The space was decorated nicely and it was close by to bus lines and restaurants. The host was very responsive and overall I feel satisfied.
14455104,101697664,,43090878,Michael,Hung did a great job communicating and setting us up in his house. The place was clean and all the furniture seemed brand new. The neighborhood is a little noisy but that is to be expected being right on MLK way. We were a party of 5 so the 4 bedrooms worked out great(much better than a hotel). Parking was good both on the street and behind the house. Not too far from the city and we all really enjoyed our stay.
7.16E+17,7.21E+17,,430950467,Alisa,"Cozy family home with the wooden deck close to the lake. Steven is a very friendly and welcoming host, he showed me the house and told me everything I needed. Perfect place for a rest."

7636185,45750886,,43121426,Simon,"Angela met us when we arrived and made us feel very welcome. She accommodated our short notice request, and provided lots of local knowledge and advice on places to go in Seattle - including a great little local pub just around the corner! The area has some nice cafes and restaurants and a local supermarket a few blocks away. Jefferson Park, a beautiful neighborhood park just up the street from the property, offers a stunning view of Seattle.<br/>The location was a short walk to the train station with direct link to the city center and airport, and there are local buses nearby. <br/>The cottage was perfect for our needs, clean, spacious, and nicely presented, with a fully equipped kitchen, modern bathroom, comfy bed and plenty of closet space. It is also air-conditioned, has a large TV, with cable, and a good selection of books. Wifi was available and worked well.<br/>The cottage is a stand-alone building, at the rear of Angela and Herman's house. The set-up is private and easily accessed. Street parking was available.<br/>We really enjoyed our stay, and would strongly recommend this cottage to any couple who are keen to stay reasonably close to the center of Seattle.<br/>Thank you, again, Angela and Herman, for your hospitality!"
9110560,56497229,,43180582,Anderson,"Comfortable room.<br/>Convenient to take bus.<br/>There is a 24hours supermarket nearby.<br/>David is a good host who doesn't live with us."

He was readily available to contact and responded promptly to requests, and he gave us our space/was not intrusive. The space is very comfortable and roomy, and he has very nicely decorated it. The bed was comfortable. It's very conveniently located, and there's a park right near by. I would definitely stay here again."

3263071,14839454,,4335011,Marie,"This listed is as expected. Basic but clean apartment. Good for a few nights if you need to be by UW. Melissa is very nice and efficient. The only thing is the WiFi was very slow at night around 10 and later. I was only surfing the web, not downloading or streaming anything, and it was still a bit slow. Perhaps another router for the building is needed."

41976700,6.62E+17,,434141356,Evan,This apartment is great. Perfect location in the heart of seattle with tons of restaurants and coffee shops to walk to within 10 minutes. I would highly recommend staying here is you need a temporary place to stay as the appliances are top notch and the gym is a nice perk too.
28713206,333809867,,43414789,Samantha,"We were Tim & Leslie’s first Airbnb “clients” and we were so pleased! The space is super homey and cozy! The digital fire place was an amazing bonus! We could walk to a great area for dinner and breakfast which were delish! And with them being close to a bus stop, we have no problem navigating to downtown! The sweetest couple! Would 100% recommend ??"
23275901,279480995,,4352201,Larry,"Beautiful home! Brand new construction and appliances. Great location. Wonderful, friendly host. Communicated quickly and was very helpful."
30024068,757602575,,43535633,Charles,"Melissa’s apartment is in a perfect location - within walking distance of the beautiful UW campus, the University District, the UW Medicine Montlake medical center, Husky Stadium, University Village, the picturesque Montlake Cut, the Arboretum, breathtaking mountain views, Lake Union and Gasworks Park. If you have a car, it has fantastic access to I-5 North and South. You won’t find better access to some fantastic sights, smells and sounds of Seattle. Melissa was very kind, even when I was the one in error around a complaint I made. Parking is very tight (spaces are small and cramped) in the building lot and during the week there was absolutely nothing on the street, though it is free if you can find it. What was a bit strange was that during my initial Airbnb app email back and forth Melissa was articulate, smart and wrote in perfect English, matching her bio which describes her as a PhD in a field of economics and a mom. At some point this erudite Melissa transitioned to someone who wrote in very fragmented English. The transition was so jarring that at first I thought I was hacked, as she suddenly sent me a URL link out of the blue to a bizarre news article about Taiwan becoming the 51st state. The Airbnb picture shows a squeaky clean room, nicely furnished, well lit, and with a TV flat screen. Right away Melissa told me that the room would not be clean in time for me to move in, but she had a three bedroom place she could substitute if I didn’t use the other two rooms. I agreed. When I got there, it was in a basically clean but run down, dimly lit place with one bedroom that had the windows open wide, perhaps to mask the distinctive, unremovable sooty smell of years of once heavy cigarette smoking that had occurred there in the past. I got over it, but between Melissa 1, Melissa 2, Taiwan as the 51st state, the room switcheroo, and the contrast between the room in the picture and the room I was in, many guests would have been seriously weirded out. Anyway, the room location kept me happy enough. So what if Melissa 1 is an erudite economist, Melissa 2 hardly speaks English and sends me bizarre URLs, and the room has 1950s appliances and smells like decades of unremovable tobacco soot. It was only 4 nights after all, and the windows could have been closed and locked...right? But, come on, let’s be fair: Washington DC and Puerto Rico both deserve Statehood WAY before Taiwan."
35879017,483811620,,43538057,Michael,"Kim is the perfect host! She was super kind, accommodating, and friendly! In the room she left a great list of recommendations and very helpful descriptions of each place! We fell in love with the neighborhood quickly.<br/>The room was clean and had everything we could possibly need plus a couple treats!<br/>I’d consider anyone lucky to stay in this Airbnb ??<br/>Best deal around - Fuhgeddaboudit!!"
48538993,7.39E+17,,435901712,Mariano,"Small but cozy apartment in downtown Seattle. Probably one of the best priced places you'll find while you figure things out. The Blueground team always answered my questions before, during and after my stay. Sometimes they took a bit to respond, but I always received a professional and thorough answer.<br/>Blueground makes sure you have everything you need for your stay.<br/>I appreciated the welcome kit, the fast internet, the professional service and quality.<br/>Very walkable area with access to public transport. Very close to Pike Place Market as well."
11638111,69380983,,43635990,Jiaying,It was really a nice stay. David was very responsive and thoughtful. The house was clean and nice with everything you need. Highlly recommended.
9522082,58438668,,43645709,Fernando,"We had a wonderful experience at this property and will be sure to look for it again should we visit Seattle in the future. We were thrilled to be the first to rent it and the owners really nailed it in terms of setting us up for success.<br/>Denise was great to work with, super responsive and ready to help even before we arrived with tips about the area and things to do for our entire family.<br/>The home is fantastic (we may be slightly biased as we live in a Victorian home ourselves - coincidentally built the same year as this property). It is tastefully remodeled yet keeps all the charm and character of its era. It is extremely clean, comfortable (perfect for our family of four), cozy, well updated and best of all in an AMAZING location, walking distance from many attractions, restaurants, supermarkets and shops."
39923691,6.6E+17,,4366899,Vija,"This home is a great place for your stay in Seattle! It was exactly as described - a nice, quiet home in a cute neighborhood. Lindsey was very responsive and the entire process was easy with her. Would definitely recommend to anyone wanting to stay in the city!"
7462250,68204408,,4371115,Jean,"What a delightful gem in the city yet away from it all in a quiet little neighborhood in West Seattle. I stayed there on a Thursday recently and was greeted by the host, Sarah. who showed me to the studio. She was friendly and helpful, and had left information about the area's restaurants. <br/><br/>Though a studio, the apartment felt spacious with its pitched ceilings. Everything was wonderfully new and sparkling clean. The bed is comfy. I didn't try the couch bed but it seemed a nice addition if there are more than two staying. The kitchen was well appointed with all appliances. My stay was short so I didn't need much except the coffee pot! Cute little bathroom with tub and shower. Loved all the amenities.<br/>This apartment is situated in back of the family home. It is above their garage and has an outside stairway entrance. It is very private. I would recommend this place to anyone visiting the Seattle area. There is shopping nearby. West Seattle's restaurants and shops are a few block walking distance and Seattle downtown is 10 minutes away. <br/>Thank you, Sarah! I'll be back for sure!!"
902609,3883567,,4373633,Tj,"My stay at Fabio's studio was great! The place was very clean when I arrived along with a few item even in the fridge. The studio had all of the amenities that I needed, even it's own private entrance where I could come and go as I pleased. Great location as well, not too far from downtown and other attractions! <br/> Fabio was a great host! He is very knowledgeable about the area and has a lot of really interesting stories tool. He is very quick to respond and if you need anything he is more than willing to help make it happen! Fabio even took me out and showed me the town, my own personal tour guide! He also reminded me to turn off my interior light in my car a couple times so my battery wouldn't die! I would highly recommend staying with Fabio while visiting Seattle!"
7971395,46840921,,43804516,Emily,Just as described. Everything was very clean and new. The host was very responsive and easy to get in contact with. The room had everything we could need and has a private entrance through the backyard which we were given keys for. Lovely.
36878218,512970455,,43809681,Margaret,"Brenna & Joe's guest house was nothing short of wonderful. You can tell there was much love and thought put into building the beautiful space. Smart design and tasteful touches make for a cozy but comfortable living space with all the amenities. It was super clean too! <br/>You couldn't ask for a better location, just a few blocks off the main strip at Alki Beach. We were able to enjoy all the spots without having to worry about driving and parking! <br/>Aside from the lovely space and location, they were there to greet us upon arrival (along with their adorable dogs) and went above and beyond to make sure we were taken care of -- going as far as setting out lit candles for us on the patio upon our return from an evening out :) <br/>We highly recommend this place!"
8306501,47846437,,43882163,Alexandria,"As my first Airbnb experience, I was a little nervous but instantly felt right home! My room was super cute and I had my own bathroom that came with body wash, shampoo, conditioner and towels which was a huge plus. Their outside deck had an absolutely beautiful and stunning view of the Olympics (I'm a very outdoorsy person so that was something extra special for me while I visited). Also a great location - only a few minute walk to downtown Fremont. I stayed with them for 10 days and it really felt like my home away from home. I highly recommend staying with this awesome and super friendly couple! My first experience was 100x better than I could've imagined."
13033576,80248729,,43895594,Peter,"It has a very nice scenery, very tranquil. A place where you would like to come home to."
846763,3202228,,4393791,Suzie,"Tara was kind and communicative. We got to the house early evening and she called to check on us and make sure we knew how to find her. She made us feel at home:-).<br/>The room and bath were just as she described in the basement. Very comfortable bed! Could have used another bedside table with more light on the other side of the bed for reading. Also, no soap in the shower and we were in a hurry to leave the next day unfortunately.<br/>Homemade granola in the morning was yummy! Thank you!! Good coffee as well.<br/>Great location. Would have liked to walk to Ravenna Park in the morning.<br/>Our first Airbnb experience. We are planning to try you out in Hilo, Hi. very soon!"
10677610,66936218,,43959576,Meredith,"We were in town for work and stayed in Tamara's condo for two weeks. It was exactly as pictured: compact, neat and bright. The check-in/check-out process was seamless and she was very attentive. The location is great- close to restaurants, bars and downtown. Because the condo faces an alley and it is next to a bar, on the weekends, there was some late night noise from the patrons and also from employees taking out the trash and recycling after hours. We also found the tap water undrinkable, which I mentioned to Tamara and she advised she would look into it. All in all, it was a good airbnb experience."
18358544,152059104,,44121060,Mark,"Joshua's place in Madison Park is in a perfect location, close to Lake Washington, good restaurants, a hidden gem of a wine shop, and a quick drive up to the restaurant districts on Capitol Hill. The apartment is well appointed, with a great shower and comfortable furnishings. Strongly recommended!"
28786706,338509674,,44123592,Margaret,"Barbara was a fantastic host and I’d highly recommend her place for your stay in Seattle. She provided a quiet and clean environment where I could get work done while visiting friends for two weeks. Delicious breakfast and coffee were provided each morning and Barbara was happy to share local Seattle tips. The house was a couple blocks from grocery stores, cafes and accessible to public transit throughout Seattle (downtown, capital heights, to ballard)."
27331743,311242013,,44131955,Haley,This place was beautiful! I would definitely stay again. The host was great! Very thoughtful and easy to contact. The kitchen and bbq were so wonderful to make our meals and the patio was the perfect place to eat them. It was such a great experience!
7305969,38468259,,4422077,Robert,"Emily was a terrific host. Super clean and very private bedroom on the bottom level of a 3 level home. I was the first airbnb visitor and the space had just been remodeled. Modern. Great, comfy bed. Great Shower. She had good input on the neighborhood. Walking distance to a ton of different stuff (I wandered and left the car behind). I will stay again!"
9174327,55261759,,4422998,Teresa (Terri),"We really enjoyed this charming setting during our Thanksgiving week stay. The care and thoughtfulness put into making this room and the accessories comfortable are evident in everything from the décor to the practical availability of the mini kitchen where we were able to create our contribution to our family holiday dinner. Judy is a welcoming and helpful host; we especially appreciated the maps of the area and robes and slippers that were provided. As it was a holiday trip, we spent most of our time with family but look forward to staying here again on future trips."
7839535,47895017,,44265286,Joshua,Alex did a great job of making us feel welcome. The place was clean and organized. The community was very nice and quiet. We were out there for a wedding and had never been to Seattle before but Alex gave us some advice as to where to go and what to do. We enjoyed our stay and appreciated the hospitality.
9.25E+17,9.32E+17,,442709612,Kinidi,"Was a last minute booking because my grandmother was in the hospital. Host was always very responsive and helpful, even brought extra chairs and a table for us to have family over for dinner."

24357607,5.67E+17,,444426990,Michael,"Wish’s place is very comforting. There are plenty of kitchen supplies and whatever you might need to feel at home. There’s even coffee, tea, snacks, and some emergency canned food if you don’t have a car and arrive after hours like I did. I rarely see another renter but those I saw in passing seem very nice and content as well."
8081658,53972568,,44461916,Ramy,We have been in this location for the past 45 days and have greatly enjoyed our stay. Kelly has meticulously cared for this unit and it shows. It's very comfortable as advertised. The neighborhood is fantastic with great amenities and restaurants within walking distance. We hope to extend our stay a little longer!
48266237,6.77E+17,,444796337,James S,"Our family enjoyed this wonderful house. The location is perfect, near useful bus lines that go to desired places. It is clean and the host is very available. Check-in was effortless. We enjoyed the kitchen for food preparation and the large dining room table for communal meals Didn't get to use the back yard much but it is a real draw, too. This home was comfortable for the 8 of us and met our needs. Thank you!"
14201915,94004151,,4448946,Alexander,"Great Lake view and park next to the house. Apartment is clean and new. Nice media room. Host was great and very helpful, told me couple of nice places to visit in Seattle."
46066887,710105930,,44519711,Jon,Good place for the price. It’s a basement apartment unit with the essentials. Good communication from the host. Coin-operated washer & dryer available. Bring earplugs if you’re a light sleeper - not much sound insulation from the floor above. Overall good place to stay for the week.
8426827,48625143,,44535684,Edgar,"We had a wonderful stay at the Eva Rose apartment! It was in a wonderful location with the ability to walk to many restaurants, coffee shops and more. It was quiet and had everything we needed. They even had a pack n play for us to use for our 7 month old which was so nice. Jeremy was so welcoming and helpful in suggesting places to try out! They had a bottle of wine waiting for us which was a very nice touch! We were visiting to check out Ballard as a potential place to move to and this was the perfect home base to venture out from and see the area. I highly suggest this rental and we will definitely use it again in the future if we move for family/friends! Fantastic stay!!!Thanks again!<br/>"
8187592,48633902,,44537187,Bilin,Jorge is an excellent host! His house is really nice and comfortable. There's a light rail station to downtown Seattle and airport within 10 minutes walk. I would recommend Jorge's house to people visiting Seattle!
13823956,84835371,,44588512,Jodi,"My stay at Wendy's Ballard Garden Flat was great, even better than the description and pictures reveal. The flat itself is comfortable and really is an appealing place to spend time - bathroom is really contemporary and has great lighting making getting ready in the morning a pleasure. The real bonus here is the fabulous outdoor space. Rain or shine you can use it as it's adequately covered and there's a heat lamp for chillier nights. I got lucky and the sun was out in the late day making it the perfect place to relax prior to heading out for the night. <br/><br/>I had asked Wendy for suggestions for places to dine in Ballard while visiting and specified I would be dining alone so a bar would be preferred. She hit it spot on by suggesting San Fermo. In the end it was such a beautiful night that I chose to dine outside in the patio area.<br/><br/>Thanks Wendy!"

8418650,51167696,,44679236,Nicole,"We rented this duplex for my parents visiting from out of town:<br/><br/>My wife and I came to Seattle to visit our kids and the unique character of Washington along with the extended beauty of Canada. At the end of our little trip our kids arranged our last couple of nights at Susan Matthews newly renovated condo. upon arriving you couldn't really see from the front the amount of effort and cost of the many features and amenities that filled this custom duplex. Susan has just about thought of everything, even right down to the phone charger on the back of the alarm clock in the master bedroom. We were the first renters so it was nice to be in a freshly put together place. The large living room windows enjoyed a very spacious, private patio with conformable seating, nicely manicured landscape with a few squirrels going about their business. There was every comfortable feature incorporated into the bathroom with an outstanding shower that had a custom ventilation system that totally kept this room from fogging and misting the walls and mirror. The bathroom and all other rooms had it's own thermostat and heater which allowed for a very comfortable stay. We would come back if it was available and highly recommend it to anyone considering a visit to Seattle. <br/>"
18370014,158459253,,44767623,David,"I rented Gerry's place for my parents that were visiting me in Seattle. The place is fantastic, in a very quiet and cozy part of Seattle. It's a short walk to lots of food and drink options as well as groceries. The place itself from my experience with airbnb's was above average to exceptional. Gerry had nearly everything you could possibly think to need, including offstreet parking which is a plus in a city. I f you're looking for a hopin night spot or place to party this won't be it but if youre looking for a private and quiet place in a busy city this can't be beat. For my parent's first Airbnb they had an great experience so I have Gerry to thank for that! They'll be telling their friends and I'd happily recommend Gerry's place to my friends that visit. <br/>Here's my moms review:<br/>We recently visited our son in Seattle and he found us this nice airbnb to stay. Not knowing what it would be like we were very pleasantly surprised. It was very clean and had everything and more than we expected. So much better than a hotel and the price was great. Gerry and Walter were very helpful in every way. I would highly recommend their place. It's peaceful, quiet, bright and most of all clean...and we even had fresh flowers. It was our first experience with an airbnb stay"
51587153,6.94E+17,,447730754,Nalin,Decent location from downtown close to express bus line and not too far from train. Aurora street is a bit odd but the neighborhoods nearby are nice. The house is a bit old but decent internet. One thing that stands out is communication and the accommodations given by the host.
8307502,48824826,,44790821,Carrie,"We loved our short stay in West Seattle. The accommodations were absolutely beautiful, and our host was fantastic. We wished we could have stayed longer and look forward to staying here again in the future."
8507062,48654995,,44792761,Behrad,"David was the best host I've had. His house is immaculate, his location is great, and he himself is very interesting to talk to. I was lucky enough to have him keep me company and show me the neighborhood when I was bored and we had a great weekend hanging out because of it. Highly recommended."
7.7E+17,8.42E+17,,448331,Magnus,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Elisabeth's home our first two weeks of moving up to Seattle. She was really accommodating, quick to answer any questions we had and made the stress of our move fade away. The place was spotless, wifi was good and the bed was super comfy.<br/>We'd highly recommend Elisabeth's place for anyone needing to work from home while staying in Seattle. 10/10."
36041891,7.54E+17,,448446717,Angela,"Wonderful condo right in the heart of West Seattle. It is well stocked and very clean and cozy. It is walking distance to a number of restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping, ect... And just a short drive to the ferry docks, Alki, Lincoln park, and Admiral Theater. You are also a quick 20 minute drive to downtown Seattle. If you are planning on visiting the Seattle area, I highly recommend this location as it will give you an unlimited amount of things to do, and is perfect for tourist attractions."
48900814,746217319,,44891909,Jen,Absolutely beautiful apartment. The location was within everywhere you want to be. Siena couldn’t have been a more gracious and responsive host. We will definitely stay again. ??
46037172,9.24E+17,,4490298,Kevin,Great accommodations for a quick 1 night work trip in Seattle!
2486612,10790788,,44934,Darren,"Thanks so much to Genjo, Dana and Michael for welcoming us at a moment's notice. We were rolling into Seattle after a long road trip not sure of where we were staying that night and within minutes of requesting, they replied and readied the place for us. We were honored to be their first airbnb guests in their beautiful and quiet apartment atop a zen meditation center. It's located in a nice suburb within walking distance of some great restaurants (try the Mexican place around the corner) and very easy and close to all major metro areas. My only regret is not taking them up on their offer to join the meditation class but we were all to tired after the trip. I definitely will if I find myself In Seattle again. They were also very flexible with our schedule and let us book a second night on the spot. I can't recommend their accommodations and hospitality highly enough. Thanks!!"
8248970,49396873,,44953766,Beth,"Since this was my first experience with Airbnb, I appreciated that the host contacted me so quickly to answer all my questions and to help me navigate the booking process. The host showed concern for our individual needs. She was kind and very welcoming in her correspondence. The description of the house was completely accurate. It was roomy, beautifully furnished and clean. The bed linens were high quality and the towels were soft and plentiful. The kitchen was well furnished with quality utensils that made cooking enjoyable. We were very comfortable. The neighborhood was clean and quiet. Both the house and the neighborhood were truly a retreat for our family. We would definitely rebook at this location."
12632193,5.86E+17,,449596932,Gabriel,Amazing in every regard. Hospitality at its finest. Andrew is an amazing host. Highly recommend!
7533537,50579568,,45018114,Sarah,"Janet was amazing. She was extremely accommodating and had prepared a helpful little guide for us about all the amenities in West Seattle (a very hip little neighborhood close to Downtown Seattle.) Her studio was exactly as described and very cozy (ladies, the fancy shampoo/conditioner and hair dryer/flat iron/curling iron selection was a definite plus.) Janet even took our coffee bean order to make sure she had the type on hand that we liked (we requested a local coffee and she delivered, it was delicious!) The location was great, only a 15 minute-ish car ride from Downtown Seattle and really close to the water if a morning shore-side walk is your thing. Upon Janet's request, before leaving for the airport on our last morning, we had breakfast at a record store that doubles as a diner called Easy Street Records, about a 3 minute drive from her place. Definitely would recommend for any audiophiles visiting the area, we picked up an album from an Oregon band we love that we've never seen anywhere else. It was Sunday morning and there was also an incredible looking farmers market, great people watching and there's lots of other nice restaurants in the area if diner food isn't your thing. <br/><br/>Next time I visit Seattle, I won't need to look any further for awesome accommodations. Thanks Janet!!"
48041067,745587128,,45085728,Timothy,"Tugba’s place at the Wave is simply amazing. This is a new building overlooking the Puget Sound. The unit is on the 25th floor and has nothing that high anywhere near around it. On the south end, you can peer over and into Lumen field and on the west end you have the container shipping operation with its cranes on Puget Sound and to the northwest is the Ferris Wheel and Pike Place. On a clear day you can see the snow capped Olympics over the Puget Sound. It is lovely. <br/>The space has two desks to work in for a longer term rental. There is also a business center on the 2nd floor and a<br/>Gym/yoga area. Tugba can reserve gym use for you. Our host was very accommodating for our month long stay, and was always available for questions like when the internet went out that one time and for other issues. One of the things I liked the most was the garage for our rental car. Trash and recyclables was also easily disposed of in a room with chutes on the same floor as the condo. There is also rooftop access, but it’s shared with all residents. <br/>There is a wonderful convenience store within the building that doesn’t display its prices. We should have noticed that before paying $21 for a carton of milk, pasta and tomato sauce. The building is also home to a trendy Japanese place called Matsu. <br/>One of the best things about the location is that you can walk 10 minutes up post alley to Pike Place and get fresh baked items at the many bakeries there. <br/>I would love to return."
49838282,4.65E+17,,45158488,Brad,"A great home in a great location. The layout is cozy and comfortable, with great new fixtures and amenities in just about every room. We ate most meals at the high kitchen island. Hosting a formal seated dinner would be challenging in the space, but I'd recommend taking it up to the roof. Speaking of which, the fully furnished roof deck with a view of downtown and Mt. Rainer is icing on the cake. <br/>Know that, some days, planes fly low overhead on their way to land at Sea-Tac and that, as of early autumn 2021, there's a fair amount of construction in the neighborhood. Didn't bother us too much, but if you're a light sleeper, maybe bring some earplugs. <br/>There are great restaurants, bars, and shops in quick walking distance with easy wheeled access to the rest of the city. The host is thoughtful and very responsive."
18492251,4.4E+17,,45175962,Tri,"Nice and recently renovated studio apartment with a good value. It is really close to UW campus and bus/train station that can take you to downtown Seattle. The only two complaints that I have are (though they are by no means a deal breaker):<br/>1. In general, the apartment has good sound isolation between rooms. However, there are usually loading trucks in the early morning (at maybe 6-7 AM) that can be pretty loud. <br/>2. There is no way to lock the door from the inside.<br/>Overall, it has been a really nice stay. Thanks, Melissa for being a very professional and responsive host."
32922642,453748204,,45199158,Steve,"Lynne's property couldn't have been better for my needs. Very communicative host, clean and modern property, and a great location. I recommend this property without hesitation (as long as you don't mind a few stairs)."
6.9E+17,7.16E+17,,452278703,Sonja,"Clean, comfy, convenient spot! Pretty close to the airport, like a 15min drive.<br/>Bed was very comfortable. Keypad entry was convenient because I checked in late at night.<br/>It’s a basement unit so there was occasionally some footsteps that could be heard overhead but it was very minimal and I was warned that might happen.<br/>Hosts are very helpful and quick with communication!"

21886733,465973430,,45378517,Travis,Decent house that is well suited for a large group who are looking for a place to crash. Quick access to light rail.
12847258,75815881,,4539354,Dave,"Rainer and Jing have made a comfortable little space. Make no mistake, this is a micro home-bare necessities, but again plenty comfortable if you're looking to crash in a comfy bed at an affordable price. The home is in a quiet and well-maintained residential area-walkable to Seattle Center, downtown, and Capitol Hill. I was regularly coming back late at night from work and felt perfectly safe.<br/>The bed is super comfortable! Check it out."
18949136,155808624,,45485976,Sornsawan &Quot;Sonee&Quot;,"Debbie saved the day! Due to a mishap with a different airbnb booking we were left without a room on memorial day weekend. We did instant book with Debbie and she was attentive, kind, gave us suggestions to local sea food places, provided fantastic drinks and meals while we were there and was so incredibly kind. Fabulous host! The views of the Puget sound here are to die for and I love that it's just a short walk from the beach. Highly recommend!"
7344117,39115395,,4563050,Tyler,"Jessie is both helpful and very personable. As we were her first air bnb guests after taking this home off of the 'for sale' market, there was still organizing and staging/setting up to finish when we arrived. We became the beta test for all future guests-- Jessie both provided us with an amazing compensation for any inconvenience that it may have caused, and some sparkling wine. Yum! The space is beautiful, five minutes from downtown, and we were more than happy with our experience. I would recommend this place to anybody that finds it on line. Thank you, Jessie!"
11392479,70597460,,456614,Mimi,"Staying here was like a breath of fresh air during my work travels. The accommodations were pleasant and comfortable as described. I felt right at home. The location is close to everything in a quiet neighborhood. They were wondeful tour guides and not only gave me suggestions on places to go, but also took me for a trail walk at The Discoveey Park/Beach. We spent time hanging out around my work schedule and they also invited me to an at home dinner with friends which was a wonderful change from dining out while ""on the road"". The days were filled with laughter and story-telling and they made me feel more like a friend or long lost family member more than just a guest. They were stellar Hosts and the accommodations were wonderful. I highly recommend this location for any nomadic business traveler like myself or just for the casual traveler. I wish I would have stayed longer. I will definitely be returning in the future."
7.64E+17,8.17E+17,,4579252,Laura,"Jessica’s place was beautiful, clean and spacious. Has amazing views over lake Union, coffee shops nearby and it’s a walkable distance to the downtown area especially if you don’t have a car. Communication with Jessica was easy and she was always happy to respond if there was an issue ! Highly recommend!"
25444751,280219239,,457982,Scott,"Lyle is lightning fast with communication. Check-in was a breeze and the apartment has a simple, effective set-up. The location is ideal. <br/>I used the apartment as a home base while in Seattle for work meetings. I could easily walk downtown for meetings during the day, then drop off my gear and walk up the street to fantastic restaurants / bars in the evening. The convenience of this place makes it a winner."

7.18E+17,7.81E+17,,45850287,Stephanie,"We loved staying at Ariana’s place! I was worried about parking but we never had any issue finding street parking in the neighborhood very close. Ariana was extremely responsive and friendly, and was a joy! <br/>One thing I’d mention for tall people - my friend is 5’11 and just cleared the beams and some doorways, and found the shower a bit cramped for her height. :)"
17345311,137645999,,45857002,Yinuo,"The location of Lynn's flat is very good, walkable to Seattle center and pike marketplace, also very close to public transportation. The flat is just as shown in the picture, clean and decent. Communication with Lynn and John has been smooth and easy. We love this flat and we had a great time in Seattle."

21945749,216944675,,4591708,Jessica,"LOVED staying here! The house was super clean, spacious and comfortable and the location couldn't be better. It was a really quaint, quiet Seattle neighborhood and still walkable and super close to downtown. It’s on a super cute, tree-lined quiet side street but just around the corner there are a few nice restaurants, a bagel shop and a cute bookstore/cafe that really felt very Seattle. There was also a bus to downtown right at the corner which was super convenient. Michelle was super attentive and responsive and a very gracious host. Highly recommend staying here."
20287404,238485695,,45958583,Mayra,"We were very excited to be Joyce's first Airbnb guests. The space was quiet, clean and cozy in a very safe neighborhood. She was an excellent host and I would recommend this space to anyone looking for a place to stay in Seattle!"
1205666,4913288,,4601841,Lei,"My dog and I had a great first experience with airbnb at Sean and his family's house. They were welcoming, friendly and even offered to look after my dog if I wanted to go out for dinner! The room was very clean and the bathroom spotless. The bed is one where you won't want to get out of in the morning! They're just across the street from a lovely park where you can enjoy a leisurely walk and take in the tranquility, by the water. All in all, a wonderful stay and I highly recommend it."
7800238,51382025,,46085428,Oy,Amazing experience in a beautiful cottage near dt Seattle. We came out for a romantic weekend and the cottage was more than perfect. Andy and Betty provide a very unique experience. They have a beautiful home and provided the privacy we were looking for as a couple. If I ever go back to Seattle I will certainly try to stay with Andy and Betty again
41348998,595755735,,4611317,Melissa,"Great spot for exploring Capitol Hill and downtown Seattle. So nice to have a coffee shop right across the street! Very little street parking. And a funky, vintage building. We had a great time. Thank you!"
31294061,406233863,,46128608,Peter,"Angielena's place has a lot of old town charm. It is on the second floor of an older building, clean, but not brand new. My room was very nice, with a comfortable bed., heater, a small toaster oven, coffee maker, and toaster oven. There was a lot of art on the walls, a shared kitchen area, and 3 bathrooms. I did not make much use of the kitchen so can't speak about that. The bathrooms were clean except when a guest (I'm assuming) didn't clean up well after themselves. One shower was under renovation and was finished the day that I left. That would be a deluxe 8 headed shower, however it was not ready during my stay.<br/>There was definitely some noise. While I was there it was at a low to medium rumble of conversation and music. There was not a lot of spikes. It is above a bar/ lounge. This was mentioned, and I think that the description was fairly accurate. I was able to meditate, fall asleep, and stay asleep without much negative influence from the noise. I can see how it can be an issue for light sleepers though. <br/>Angeilena was prompt with her responses to texts or messages through the AirBnB messaging service. We both had windows for which we could meet up for the check in and within that window she was flexible although I had last minute changes. She and her staff were very personable. I had no issue with the staff nor the facility.<br/>This neighborhood is within or close to an industrial area of town. There are quite a few options for places to get something to eat. I did not find much for grocery markets or convenience stores, except for one at the Shell station."
21148583,322278357,,46146073,Alissa,"Maura and Mark are extremely nice and genuine hosts. Communication was great throughout the whole 4 month stay. The house was clean and close to a dog park, Lake Washington, Seattle, and all other essential stores. The house is older so thin walls allows noise to travel at times. Overall a great stay!"
13191810,77595432,,4615878,Yuanlin,"I was the first ever guest at this place! Caroline looked really excited to have a guest less than a day it was listed.<br/><br/>Stayed for a week. The location was extremely convenient. It is walkable distance to Pike St Market, Space Needle+EMP, downtown conference centres and is surrounded by food outlets.<br/><br/>The house was clean, bright, and felt really cosy. There's one queen size bed and a sofa bed that is expandable to a queen. My advice is, take the sofa bed and pad it with sheets before covering yourself with the extra comforter. Now you have the TV all to yourself while sleeping on an ultra large sofa.<br/><br/>Place gets pretty chilly during spring - summer because the building radiator furnace is switched off, but it might just be because I'm from a place located on the equator.<br/><br/>Overall a really accessible and comfortable place to stay."
9157232,54285007,,46165280,Dan,Tania and her father a veer accommodating. Tania father is very knowledgable about the area and gave me some great advice. The hostess quickly responded to my text. Very kind and honest host. Room is comfortable and the full kitchen is a nice addition. I would recommend a stay with Tania anytime.

8848854,55008530,,46332694,Judy,The house is just as seen in the photos. It was cozy and comfortable. We would recommend it.
40539898,604279799,,4634084,Juliana,"My pup and I stayed here for about a month and had a great time. It was just what we needed - good size apt, nice/cozy decor, 5-10 min drive to QA stores and downtown, parking spot, and the patio will be a plus for warm sunny days! <br/>Becky was very friendly and communicative about things happening at their house or neighborhood that could impact us. Since this is a basement there can be some noise transfer from when there’s a lot of movement upstairs - which I was aware of based on her description here - but nothing that bothered me or happened in inconvenient hours. She let me use their W/D, which I really appreciated since I was there for a long stay. Bentley (their dog) is a sweetheart and my pup even got to play with him in their huge yard! I’d definitely recommend Becky’s place!"
8.75E+17,8.79E+17,,463479932,Marc,This is a perfect place to stay if you are looking to spend time in the city! The place is small but it’s all you need to live the DT life style. Super easy to get around and lots to do. Bed was comfy but a little hot as it’s a loft. Parking was a little tough but not the worst! Easy to get around without a car anywhere in the city. I had to make a last minute change to my trip but james and Jeffry were very helpful in accommodating my changes. The recommendations they gave were also great. I will definitely stay here again.
6.59E+17,6.93E+17,,463927484,Kenya,"Jen,<br/> Firstly the house was listed as having AC and it didn't have any AC. We were not told about this until after we arrived and called Jen to ask about the house being hot and the Thermostat on the walls not working. Jen stated she found out just the day before and bought fans. The fact that she was renting a place and not aware of this is a huge concern. There was also a roach in one of the rooms when we got there (it was dead and we didn't see others) and the bed in that same room broke when it was sat on. Also whoever cleaned the place weren't thorough because the tub in the master bathroom had a ring of scum around it. <br/>That being said, Jen did respond whenever we texted her, she came and brought more fans and bought a new bed and set it up. The house overall was roomy, it isn't as close to downtown as I would've like but it was very easy to go up one block and take the local transit to down town for free. Jen did offer a 5% refund for the inconveniences which would equal to 80 Dollars, which was definitely not enough to compensate for the issues we had. When I notified her she says she spoke to the manager and that we would get 20% back from the first night and 10% from the remaining nights, she stated that was the calculated loss percentage. I am not sure how someone can calculate someone else's discomfort level but that was the final offer, It was disappointing as my first Air BNB experience."
7748778,87904076,,46499777,Danielle,We loved the idea of camping in the city =] Perry was very personable and gave us great recommendations. We would love to stay again! Thanks!
30500795,358822124,,46502569,Michael,"Andrew has been an outstanding host! The hospitality is unbeatable! He made sure I had the best experience possible. The place is close to shops and busses which was great, too."
37640654,526969563,,46516098,Mike,"We had a wonderful experience in the sunny basement suite. The furnishing is very classy, and the bed is super comfortable. Very cute and quiet neighborhood to walk the dogs around too. Debbie and her family were very kind and understanding with our pets as well. We walked to Italian Cafe Lago for dinner, say yes to the homemade raviolis! Great vibes and food at Voula’s Cafe for breakfast too. FYI the doorway to the upstairs kitchen is at the top of the stairwell, and light noise/walking can be heard from above."
29636462,7.5E+17,,465446801,Megan,"Lisa was the perfect host and nothing was too much trouble. For a sports mad person like me, the apartment was in the perfect location, 15 minutes from Lumen Field and public transportation was right outside the door.<br/>It was a little loud due to helicopters flying into the nearby hospital and the construction work next door but even then, I would highly recommend this apartment when you stay in Seattle"
41274483,600035401,,46586495,Emily,Our team had a great stay at this delightful and stylish townhome. EASY location for all the best Seattle has to offer and a wonderful space for a work trip (or a trip with friends and family)!
10125020,58232620,,46638867,Michael,"Leela was a gracious host. She was very prompt to reply any questions I had within 30 minutes. Always went the extra mile providing detailed places to eat or parking info. Our arrival was suppose to be at 3 but due to late driver Tim and NYE traffic we showed up at 5:15. Joseph was patient enough to wait for us even though he had obligations elsewhere.<br/>The loft was amazing coming from 4 dudes. It definitely had charm and rustic feel. It definitely felt like we were in the city. We attended a music festival at WaMu theater and this was the perfect place to start and end. WaMu is about 10 minutes via Uber/Lyft.<br/>Beds and sofas were super comfy. The loft felt very roomy. Towels, kitchen, shampoo were all provided.<br/>The only negatives were that it gets cold in there relatively easy. There is no central heating, only electric for a roomy loft. It is also pretty loud at night, the windows are thin and it is a noisy part of town. <br/>Overall all 4 of us guys loved it and would recommend to anyone who needs a place in downtown Seattle."
45739380,6.33E+17,,46663140,Kevin,"My group had an awesome experience! Emmy was really communicative and answered all our questions. The place itself was a wonderful homebase for us during our trip to Seattle. It was a short walk to breweries, eateries, a grocery store, and the metro. It was super easy taking transportation to where we needed to go. I would definitely come back to Seattle again and stay here again :)"
637710,3349943,,4667134,Jenn,"We rented Farhad's house for a one night trip to Seattle, and had a complete blast! The house was amazing, complete art district charm right in the middle of great restaurants/bars/music/nightlife. We came up from Portlanf for the night for my boyfriend's birthday, I set up the rental, and the group was SO excited once we got inside! It was a big lovely house, one block from the canal, with three bedrooms, two with two beds. Farhad himself was SO geat to deal with. He let us bring our dog, and even recommended some great restaurants, one where we could bring the dog IN to eat with us! It was one block away and completely delicious:)<br/><br/>We had so much fun and would rent this place again in a heartbeat. It was both myself, and Farhad's first AirBNB experience and from my side I have to say it was completely great! If we head up to Seattle again you can bet we will be staying here again!"
39819622,9.92E+17,,46672779,Jade,"I absolutely enjoyed my stay at this amazing airbnb and felt right at home. It’s beautifully designed, peaceful, comfortable, has everything you need to cook/relax/work/feel right at home. We loved every detail Tim put in. Tim was an excellent, warm, responsive and helpful host. Blocks away from super markets, and 20-30 minutes walk to beautiful local parks."
29251722,348662001,,46735751,Lisa,"We selected this apartment as our base for a work trip to meet with clients nearby for their annual strategy planning sessions, and it is in a fantastic location - close to everything! <br/>The apartment has everything you need, and the beds are incredibly comfy. <br/>Lyle and his partner were incredibly accommodating and very quick to respond to every communication. We were very grateful for their generosity for both check in and check out times. It made what could have been tricky (with bags) and very easy business trip!"
15832847,113781373,,46786704,Yemin,"Had a great stay at this loft! It is a cute little apartment in a very good walkable location in downtown Seattle. The host is very friendly and accommodating. The only quibble would be that the walls are kind of thin, we could hear noises from upstairs and sometimes music next door but only faintly and it didn't bother us."
20474868,7.7E+17,,468259119,Naomi,"This house is charming and full of delightful touches from the iPhone and iWatch charging stations in the master bedroom to the heated floors in the baths to the elegantly stocked kitchen to the Roku TVs to the stocked keurigs. The house is clearly set up to accommodate small children, but worked perfectly for our group of six that included a middle aged couple, a physically hearty elderly person, and 3 adult children. It was exactly where we needed to be."
39949647,566547893,,46874627,Hossein,Great Airbnb! Very convenient. It was tidy and the beds were really comfortable. Robert is great with communication!
20426067,194361071,,46979061,Alena,"Chima was easy to reach and was very timely in his response. The house is easy to find, plenty of street parking (can park right in front of house). The neighborhood may look abit sketchy at night. However, the place is exactly like the pictures. It was very clean, well-lit, no odor, hot water, solid water pressure. There was also a portable heater in the room for chilly nights. There was another airbnb guest in the other room in the middle of our stay but chima will let you know. I couldnt hear the other guest or much of the outside at night, so pretty quiet. This room does have two huge windows on one side of the room with thin curtains that look out to the backyard. It felt abit weird (privacy matters) during the first night, but it was only trees, so didn't bother me afterward. The bathroom is shared, two doors access, super clean. But one of the doors kept moving despite being locked to the other guest room. Wasn't sure if it was the other guest pulling the door or air pressure or loose door. Overall, it was a pleasant stay, would recommend this place for those exploring Seattle!"
6973790,37003716,,4704857,Gretchen,"We loved the location - perfect. Your apartment was clean and had great information on places to eat, how to get there and things to do. THANK YOU Emma.<br/>With peace,<br/>Gretchen and Joe."
18491674,175393636,,47121613,Stephen,"Andy’s place was exactly what I was looking for, a beautifully designed, clean, well equipped, spacious place with its own private entrance, and quiet at night so I could easily slumber in peace. :) Andy was very responsive to my multiple requests. And his check in instructions and articulations were spot on. I highly recommend his place to others. And I’d love to stay there again on my next visit to Seattle, which I hope will be soon. :)"

33803288,454653433,,47424428,Joseph,Jingjing’s place was so nice and clean and close enough to everything we wanted to do! We would definitely stay there again and recommend it to anyone traveling to Seattle.
6.88E+17,7.18E+17,,475717252,Jeffery,"Can't say enough about how wonderful this airbnb was, and how much we enjoyed our stay in this beautiful city because of it.

47939830,754824779,,47655254,Anabela,"My stay at The Maple House was surprisingly great. I was a bit hesitant because they didn’t have any reviews yet but I needed a place stay that night so I decided to give it a go and I’m glad I did! The pictures don’t do justice to the place, I mean it’s huge and even though it’s a basement it didn’t feel like it due to the high ceilings and illumination of the house. Something to note is that the front yard is still under construction and Adriana warned me at the time of my booking but that didn’t affect my stay at all. Unfortunately I didn’t have the time to spend in the fire pit but seems like something I’d like to return to.<br/>Overall a great experience and highly recommended!<br/>Thank you Adriana for hosting."
9696950,58219631,,47666145,Cameron,"Perfect getaway for two!<br/>The hosts: Devon was incredibly helpful from the very start and made sure we had all the information for checking in, out, and all our time in between. He gave us both his and Jeff's personal numbers, in case anything came up.<br/>The space: TO DIE FOR. The entire apartment is curated beautifully, the bed was one of the most comfortable I've ever experienced, the spa/steam shower (the jewel of the suite) has a hookup for music, and the kitchen has mini-fridge, glasses for whatever beverage you fancy, a little hot plate for cooking. <br/>Location: my partner and I attended a New Year's Eve party on Capitol Hill and we were close enough to walk (but did opt for a Lyft on the way back). <br/>5 stars, my partner and I are planning on staying here when we return to Seattle in the future. Thank you, Devon & Jeff!"
9813684,60232080,,47743136,Eric,Our stay at Irvin's place was close to perfect. Everything was as described and Irvin does a outstanding job at being a host. Next to opening up is whole house he showed us around in Seattle and took us to a bar to watch the Seahawks play. His house is very close to a beautiful beach and half an hour by bus to downtown. Altogether a perfect stay with great value for your money. I would recommend the place to anyone.
51146821,9.11E+17,,477998387,Ryan,"I can wholeheartedly say that my experience in Seattle was made 100% better because of Michael, Jasmine, and the current tenant, Chelsea. They proactively taught me about the surrounding city/area and all the outdoorsy stuff to do. <br/>They encouraged exploration and asked me frequently how I was doing and how everything was going. They had a genuine interest in my attendance at Divers Institute of Technology, and being as how I am of the athletic variety, invited me along on many runs, hikes, etc.<br/>When we weren't busy doing physical activity, Michael and I would sit in front of the TV for way too long playing Zelda on my switch. Jasmine, Chelsea, and I had our ""shows"" that we would all get together and watch on various nights of the week.<br/>I feel like I made genuine friends and will keep in touch with them. If my work brings me back to the area, I certainly owe them a dinner or two of local cuisine and hot cakes. Thank you, Michael, Jasmine, and Chelsea, for everything :)."

It offers a secluded & quiet stay tucked in a quiet neighborhood yet it is so close to great restaurants, grocery stores and transit. Roosevelt is such a classic Seattle neighborhood. Staying here was simply wonderful. We'll definitely be back!"

18895355,162182559,,4793335,Samantha,"The location of Scott's apartment was more than perfect. Very close to several bus stops, an easy walk to both Westlake Station and The Seattle Center. A lot of restaurants nearby and I felt more like someone who lived in the area instead of just a tourist. Scott was great with communication and got back to me right away with answers to any question. The rooftop deck was a great place to just sit back and chill. The only downside was at the time of the rental there was no internet in the apartment. Other than that it was a great place to stay and would definitely recommend it to anyone heading into the city."

3022308,15400786,,4794380,Sue Ellen,"I have been staying in the Noble House Apartment for a little over a month now, and I'm pleased with the accommodations thus far. Full kitchen, bedroom separated by a small wall, table and small loveseat have made this place good for a traveling RN looking for a place to stay during her stint working in Seattle. <br/><br/>Quiet home and area, within walking distance to downtown U.District and their Saturday Farmer's Market, and less than a mile from U.Village where there's much shopping to be had! Not far from downtown Seattle, depending on traffic on I-5. <br/><br/>Be aware that there isn't a TV, which isn't a problem for me, but just to put it out there. Also, you'll need to purchase a zone pass to park in the area. The property isn't furnished exactly as shown in the picture, but you do have the basics.<br/><br/>Overall, if you're looking for a longer term place to rent, I'd recommend this property."
241032,682061,,479824,Bro,"Excellent all the way around. <br/><br/>Maija was an excellent host and kindly invited me to movie night on my last evening in the apartment. <br/><br/>The apartment's warm and modern design and furnishings cannot be fully appreciated with photos. I am a Seattle native and this part of Queen Anne is one of the best parts of the hill.The extremely private front porch/deck area hides behind a lush bamboo screen but a view of Elliott Bay and Puget Sound is three steps out into the welcoming yard. Very close to major transit lines and ample on-street parking for your vehicle makes traveling south into downtown (15 minutes, tops, to Pike Place Market by car, not much more by bus!!!) and traveling north across the historic Ship Canal into Ballard (which is far cooler than downtown Seattle) is almost instantaneous. <br/><br/>If you want to live like a native, connected to the city and the sea, give Maija's space a week or two."
20328571,182013647,,4808718,Jason,"Jocelyn and Steve were amazing hosts offering great local insight and entertainment recommendations. They were very communicative, quick with a response, and accommodating. The apartment itself is quite nicely appointed, comfortable, and cozy. It is located very conveniently to everything Queen Anne has to offer. I would happily stay with Jocelyn and Steve again and highly recommend their apartment to anyone traveling to Seattle."

36185059,547207388,,48290678,Kathleen,"Alycia's home was the perfect space for my son and I. This home is located in a beautiful vibrant neighborhood and we were able to walk to many places during our stay. The house was very clean and full of amenities. It is bright and cheerful and the décor is breathtaking. <br/>Alycia was very prompt in responding to us, and we had no issues at all getting into the house upon arrival.<br/>Thank you, Alycia for making our stay so enjoyable!"
284087,958436,,483342,Paul & Dominique,"I made a last minute booking with Suzanne and she was extremely helpful in taking our booking and arranging to meet us. She's easy to communicate with and truly wanted us to have a great time. The apartment is in a great location, a short walk to Capital Hill area or Downtown. The apartment was clean and came fully equipped with what we needed. There are two beds and they are both very comfortable. Overall this is a great place to stay in Seattle, and its nice and cozy to come back to at the end of the day. Definitely recommend it to anyone wishing to stay in downtown Seattle."
15438530,109147120,,48336979,Carmen,"This apartment was a great solution for our family for appointments and sightseeing in downtown Seattle. Very convenient, walkable neighborhood, wonderful hosts, modern apartment. We drove downtown and traffic and parking was not a problem. Thanks Ethan, we had a marvelous time."
36388994,7.44E+17,,484043661,Jennie,"Such a homey place to stay! It has a retro feel with every modern accommodation that is a perfect little spot for two! Briona and Caitlin are so incredible! They were amazing hosts, answering anything you need. They so welcoming; you are in great hands staying in one of their spaces!"
50024210,768619751,,48417907,Mary,Peter was very helpful with excellent communication. We would love to stay here again later in the summer.
9154294,54061492,,48426205,Catherine,"It was a little bit noisy (dog and kids) from 5 to 7 but it was the last of our worry :) Beside that, we had a wonderful stay and we very appreciate the breakfast that Lisa gave us. The bed was SO confortable, and the extra blanket was cool too. We would recomand this place to anybody that would like to go to Seattle :)"
9587410,57334599,,48431417,Harry,"Very cosy space, exactly as described and what we were looking for. Great neighbourhood and easy to get around Ballard and get downtown on the bus. Peggy was a lovely host and we enjoyed her hospitality immensely!"
17990897,150365784,,4843543,Yarrow,"Our stay at Vic and Dave's in Greenwood was excellent. Their place was cute, very clean and comfortable and easy to find and use as a base when exploring the city. The apartment was private and it felt like our own little get-away. We loved the bed so much that we are getting one for our house! There were multiple bus lines that were easy to use (20 minutes to downtown!) We went to Green Lake for a beautiful walk and morning coffees. Yum! Greenwood had great options for food, drink and some shopping and a couple of grocery stores making it easy to eat-in for breakfast. <br/>We bumped into them on our way out and they were charming and friendly. It was so peaceful and lovely that we hope to stay there again for a longer visit. Thanks Vic and Dave!"
46411408,711039013,,48439458,Sayaka,Beautiful neighborhood and home. We enjoyed our stay with our 2 year old and dog. Very accommodating and great value!
27091529,310664385,,48516340,Karen,"Lynne's place was available to us at the last minute. Great value, close to everything downtown Seattle has to offer, but Madison Park and Valley makes you feel a bit away from the hustle and bustle of they city. Great walking along Lake Washington Boulevard . Lynne was easy to work with. Our party had 6 guests and all would book with Seattle Vacation Home again!"
5137315,55161604,,48561513,Sophie,Inexpensive and nice place
7.5E+17,7.57E+17,,486773128,Jeff,"Great place, as advertised, maybe even beyond. This 2Br flat is a basement property, but don’t be fooled. This home is recently built, with all the appropriate finishes. As mentioned, the windows are large and allow plenty of natural light. During my stay, heard little to nothing from the family upstairs. <br/>The home is located in a quiet neighborhood, but with some local coffee shops and restaurants/pubs within walking distance; if you’re looking for nightlife or a neighborhood in the action, look elsewhere. Overall, a very nice, walkable 5 star option with transit options nearby."
28403400,326628650,,48711592,Joe,Great location and excellent responses with local recommendations from the host. Both bed and futon were not very comfortable.
38458925,530494195,,487679,Rana,"Absolutely perfect spot in Seattle! The location couldn't be better right in the heart of Fremont and the house itself is dreamy. Andrew has incredible taste and the whole house is filled with stylish, thoughtful, high-quality furnishings. Wildly comfortable bed with a killer view of Rainier if you're lucky to get a clear day. Andrew was communicative, pleasant, accommodating, thoughtful, etc. Can't say enough good things about this Airbnb and the host!"

52759367,6.28E+17,,48964201,Bernadette,"Cosy welcoming property - generous host <br/>Great location to supermarkets, cafe s bars restaurants as well as bush and beach walks"
9.92E+17,9.97E+17,,490270958,Marisol,It was easily accessible. A beautiful little homey place. Felt comfortable. Multiple restaurants in walking distance. When I come back to Seattle I would LOVE to stay at Ryan’s Airbnb again. REALLY enjoyed the stay.
32169794,424045763,,4903536,Jenna Nicole,"What a great stay! Dustin was extremely helpful and responded fast to all of my inquiries. Location was excellent, within walking distance to everything I could need for a multi week stay. Comfortable & clean, I am so glad I chose to stay! Would definitely recommend to other travelers looking for a small home away from home. :)"
8.98E+17,9.41E+17,,490982063,Wai,Nice house and nice place to stay
45790522,673511659,,49176436,Tyler,"Lily's place offers a stunning view of the Seattle skyline, a cozy space that will suite the needs of all travelers, and even has a foosball table to add a nice finishing touch! The price is highly competitive and frankly, after several hours of search (we were last minute), no other places came close to the value:cost here.<br/>We'll be back :) Thanks again Lily!"
25231650,274297467,,49201389,Celia,Alex and Harry were awesome! The apartment had every single detail you could ever expected! It is certainly an oasis in the middle of Seattle! Highly recommended
8.38E+17,8.82E+17,,492028484,Almedina,"If anyone wants to experience great hospitality, convenient location, clean spacious rooms, then they should definitely stay at Andrew's house. Andrew has an eye for detail and the house is very well furnished and decorated and always super clean.<br/>My host was responsive every time I had a question and everything was solved instantly. This was such a wonderful experience."
25427908,281422119,,49218221,Christine,My friends and I went to Seattle for a quick visit. Rachel’s home was really nice and comfortable. Everything was brand new and clean. Rachel and her partner were really friendly and were fast with their responses. We were able to walk to some near by places to pick up snacks... and it was a quick Uber ride to Capitol Hill and to the City Center. We enjoyed our stay at Rachel’s and recommend her Airbnb.
7257457,64300757,,49223701,Bernard,"This is the best Airbnb experience I have ever had! House is in great condition, great city view! It's so clean. And Roger is a nice host!"
9364302,277133231,,49306181,Tzu-Cheng (Efren),"A beautiful place close to the lake, and the host Dea is very considerate on small details while your stay. Overall, a joyful experience!!"
32067665,503898867,,49309408,Michelle,"Janice and her place were both lovely! Great location (beautiful yard), and everything I needed there. Check in was super easy and Janice was very welcoming! Loved it!"
877203,3932125,,4936116,Charlene,"Both Laura and her home r awesome. My mom and I stayed there for 8 days. Everything is amazing. Super clean, quite convenient for going out to the attractions, or just staying at home cooking, washing clothes, do your work. My mother and I nearly cooked everyday, and Laura is quite nice and helpful, since my mother cannot speak English. One day Laura even baked a delicious quiche inviting us to try. After all, It's just a great time there."
17791049,142956626,,49385145,Julia,"Our stay at Minerva in was absolutely perfect. Bill and Michael are exceptionally thoughtful and really focus in on the details that would make anyone's stay a wonderful experience. Real orchids by the bed, pastries in the morning, heated bathroom floor, snacks in the fridge... It felt like an oasis after a day of being out and about! Highly recommend. They are so kind and welcoming."
9367465,55521232,,49579198,Tara,"You will love staying here! Crow's Nest Cottage is full of light (high ceiling, lots of great windows) yet very private. It's tucked in the back yard of a private home, but none of the windows face any other buildings. It delivers on all three: lots of light, close access to bus line, restaurants, and shopping, and yet total privacy. It is a sturdy, beautifully designed building (I'd describe as rustic modern) with thick walls that contain sound well: blast music or shout out your creed and not be heard by neighbors. Top of the line appliances, kitchen, and bath fixtures. Lots of natural wood (butcher block kitchen counters and thick, exposed wood for loft floor which is also the kitchen ceiling). Giant ceiling fan, tank-less-on-demand-hot-water heater, skylight with a remote shade for sleeping in, and excellent light fixtures throughout. My father is an architect and I can't wait to put him up here. This place delivers a lot of simple luxuries for a very good price. The hosts, Amy and Matt have the right demeanor for Airbnb: they have a kind and easy going nature, are clear communicators, responsive to emails, calls, and texts, and are thoughtful about the details (nice towels, cutlery, kitchen ware, etc.). With kindness and good humor they set me up with everything I needed, left me alone, but were readily available when I wanted or needed to engage. You can walk down 6th Ave to Veraci Pizza or Slate Coffee shop. Walk, ride, or drive for 4 minutes over to Ballard Market to stock up the cool LG bottom-freezer fridge. I wish I could live there permanently. I will definitely be back."
46434227,711369838,,49635379,Raymond,"I loved this condo and I have stayed at many airbnbs. The location can't be beat. My sister and I felt like we had more than enough space. <br/>The living room has plenty of seating and beautiful plants in the window. The bed is big and super comfortable. We were able to cook and loved the brand new pots and pans in the unit. It was really clean and the host Lyle was available when I had any questions. The check in and out was really simple. Parking was available at a reasonable rate. Although no washer/dryer in unit, there is a laundry room on second floor. Lyle even had some quarters to make change if needed.<br/>It was a nice and relaxing time and place. You will not be disappointed. It was worth every penny and looked like the photos."
15927940,115211315,,4984489,Ty,"This place is perfect, and Matthew was best host!!! I asked about cool spots in the hood and the gems of the city and the his suggestions were spot on!!!!! The place Is super cozy, tucked away in a quite zone but is super close to the happening bars, venues, and restaurants Capitol Hill has to offer, and is just a short walk to downtown. Would def refer Matthews spot to anyone!"
13451764,82318595,,50031319,Geysa,"The location is ideal, within close proximity to key attractions. Apartment C had a view of the Space Needle which was unexpected. The space was exceptionally clean, with more and adequate amenities."
5.75E+17,7.23E+17,,50039207,Ike,"I really enjoyed Betty's place and was honored to be her first ever guest. I came back to my hometown of Seattle visiting from Alaska to take a break, see some old friends, take care of some errands for the week I was there before flying back up north for work and was lucky to find this place with how cheap it was. Betty was a good host. I hardly saw her and when I did, she was really friendly, chill and got a good vibe from my interactions with her. She made sure I was good during my stay and was a text away if I ever needed anything. With how the room is set up, I think this place is good for people who are in town for business/work or exploring the city. You have your own bathroom and the privacy you need. You have no access to a kitchen so if you're okay with ordering doordash/uber eats or going out to eat, then you should be good. There's also a 2 minute walk to gas stations nearby which is super convenient to grab some small stuff. Overall I enjoyed my stay and would love to come back to this place if it was available the next time I visit Seattle again."
8.84E+17,8.96E+17,,501889533,Tyana,"The shower was AMAZING. Everything was so clean and the plants made it feel homey. Very quiet area, I heard the birds every morning instead of seattle traffic."
27287563,314507104,,50194742,Pryor,"We had a great time in Seattle. Jeff’s place was very clean and well located. We had a rental car so we never needed to walk anywhere, but the location had easy access to W Seattle or the bridge downtown. <br/>"
8.55E+17,9.75E+17,,503064794,Jorge,"Angelique was very helpful, we appreciate your collaboration greatly!"
25754867,278289116,,50346609,Justin,"This is an awesome place to stay! Especially if you’re in town for sports. Close access to the stadiums, great area for food, and plenty of free parking. We were greeted with fresh cupcakes! Don’t miss out!"
48046428,732669669,,50425303,Elaine,"Full disclosure, I didn’t actually spend a night of the 2 day booking. I rented the space for branding photos for 8 hours, during daylight hours. <br/>The living room/kitchen was open and airy space, and the furnishings and decor were fairly new and super clean and very thoughtfully arranged . <br/>We did have an issue with the smoke alarm battery going off- there were no extra batteries at the townhouse and I contacted Sherry the host after 20 minutes of the beeping and not finding spare batteries anywhere. A co-host contacted me but was unable to come and change the batteries. Thankfully there are bar stools so my lovely photographer (whose about 5 inches taller than me) was able to reach it the smoke alarm on the ceiling. Unfortunately there were no extra batteries in the town house so we had to go to the convenience store down a block away and purchased a 4 pack of batteries. We tried the brand new batteries but none of them worked; so after almost 2 hours of the beeping throughout the townhouse and since no one was still able to come, we removed the smoke alarm unit from the ceiling. I took a picture and notified Sherry and she was quick at responding. <br/>The only suggestion I have for the Hosts is to purchase a cover for the rooftop furniture as it was completely soaked and I was unfortunately unable to get photos taken upstairs siting on the outdoor furniture as I had planned. (And I didn’t want to dirty up towels to mop up the water - we had tried to brush the water and also shake it off the cushions but they were still soaked). It was incredibly disappointing as one of the big draws of me biting the bullet and spending the money for 2 nights when I was only going to use the space for less than 8 hours was so I could take photos up there. I don’t mind the rain or overcast at all (it actually makes for much better photos ) and came prepared with umbrellas, but it was very disappointing to not be able to enjoy the space and use it for its intended use especially since the space was such a huge draw."
8.68E+17,9.2E+17,,504356706,Brandon,"What you see is what you get! Clean space with a parking spot, plenty to walk to including the landmarks and food. If you are looking for a super unique and charming stay this may not be your sort of listing, but if you want a comfortable, clean spot in the middle of everything with amenities and a hosting team that responds quickly, look no further."
8.44E+17,8.51E+17,,505327149,Mohammed,it was perfect
27894530,646430584,,50551445,Emmanuel,"A great place to stay, wonderfully clean place. Had nice facilities ( kitchen, BA ) with nice appliances ( TV, fridge, etc ). Everything you’d need away from home."
44542423,650623994,,50615318,Sharon,"Great efficiency-type apartment. Very clean and comfortable. Location is excellent with the Greenlake park nearby, great access to the freeway, and a neighborhood PCC and Walgreens nearby. There are also good restaurant options in the neighborhood."
16943987,140774268,,5066425,D Bradley,Loved the neighbourhood and ease of accommodation. Roger is super friendly and very communicative. I didn't have a single issue while staying here long-term.
49889828,9.57E+17,,507301711,Fatima,"The area is generally calm and the apartment is easy to commute to UW and DT Seattle from. The apartment was clean, has good space and Melissa was easy to communicate with when needed."
52145686,9.46E+17,,508139426,Aaron,"Jason is a great host. My only problem with this stay was the quality of the entrances to the house, both front and back. Besides that, the house itself was a great find for my internship and I’m really happy to have stayed here! Jason is super friendly and keeps everything really clean. His fridge, stove, and washer/dryer are all super nice and really modern and the room is great for internships or what have you."
25567558,280648598,,50823600,Sam,Julie and Matt did a great job welcoming us to their home. Ballard is a great place to enjoy Seattle. We were close enough to the action yet far enough away to enjoy some peace and quiet. Would love to come back and stay in our next trip out.
9.6E+17,9.72E+17,,508342693,Javier,Perfect place for a getaway in Seattle! Place was exactly as advertised and exceeded all our expectations. Would gladly come back again to stay!
7.46E+17,8.85E+17,,508425820,Herman,It’s a great place to stay the pictures did not do it justice my wife and I felt very at home the owners were very kind and welcoming would definitely stay here again. The location is peaceful and actually quite nice after spending a day in the city
11322973,69108878,,50858001,Gillian,"It was a delight to stay in Carol's home! Very clean and inviting and in a great location. Carol was a great host, she was very flexible with our arrival and departure times and offered tips, maps, and of course a warm welcoming into her lovely home. I brought my 7 year old son with me who also loved it! Carol had books he could enjoy and there are great parks just blocks away. I definitely plan to visit Carol's again when we come to Seattle!"
11143024,66510560,,50864718,Rachell,"Jana's place is great! It definitely is the perfect location to enjoy what Seattle has to offer. It's a big comfortable home with everything provided! Behind some of the trees is a really beautiful view too.<br/>Jana is also very helpful and responsive. She had a lot of recommendations for me and my friends whether they were restaurants, places to see, hiking trails.. Etc. And she always made sure we were okay or asked if there was anything else we needed. I would definitely recommend staying at her place, I know for sure that we would again! Thanks for everything Jana!"
23688200,362159014,,50909458,Keith,"When we booked Michelle's house we noticed the ad listed the title of the house as ""Zen House."" We booked the trip over the Christmas Holiday and had one of the most zen experiences of our lifetime. <br/>The location of this home allowed us to experience everything the Pacific Northwest has to offer. After driving 20 minutes from our front door, we were in the heart of downtown Seattle with the excitement and choas that the big city has to offer. After driving home, we found ourselves gazing out over Lake Washington with the snow-topped Cascade mountain range in the background. This house is located in an extremely private neighborhood on a dead end block. We found ourselves sitting on the back porch listening to the birds sing and forgetting the hustle and bustle of the downtown life we had just experienced. <br/>Michelle was an amazing host and even left us holiday cookies when we arrived. Everything in the house was practically brand new and we especially liked the heated floors and large kitchen area for family meals."
18638163,153088370,,50996822,Rachel,"The space was clean and inviting. They even provided umbrellas for those rainy Seattle days! At first glance, the location seems remote, but it's actually very centrally located. We were able to walk to restaurants, bars, and grocery stores in Queen Anne, and there was a bus 2 blocks away that takes you to the City Centre. Overall, it was a great stay!"
844939,3608022,,5099898,Jennifer,"We LOVED the location and convenience of Emma's place, right in the heart of Belltown. There were even snacks and coffee there for us, and fresh towels and extra bedding for my daughter. Definitely would stay here again!"
4879013,24350719,,510057,Ravindra,Suzanne was excellent host. Every thing is as described. They even have nice breakfast. House is very sweet and classy. They arranged everything so good that we didn't even have to contact them once.
50005203,9.55E+17,,510073971,Nicolina,"Deb was an awesome host, always solved any (minor) issues that I had very quickly. The house itself was awesome and in a quiet and safe location."
22036022,220989081,,51025138,Patricia,Lyle's apartment was really clean and neat. Check-in and check-out was simple. He also response to messages quickly. Would definitely recommend Lyle's apartment to my friends.
4129218,56577390,,51036041,Erik,"Derek was very welcoming and went out of his way to be sure that everything about his apartment went smoothly. This apartment is modern and clean. It comfortably sleeps 4 and decor and lacks for nothing. Kitchen is fully functional. Bathroom works with style. Open space kitchen living room sleep area has a nice flow. The bed was extremely comfortable. Everything in this apartment is up to date with modern look. I feel that I got my money's worth and more. Within one block of the main street on Capital Hill, its location is perfect. If you want a memorable Seattle experience, try Derek's. Don't think you will be disappointed."
47151007,725697578,,51088755,Marina,Good apartment. I’m was enjoying to stay there.
25381145,306585712,,5109504,Joyce,"Tim and Michelle’s place hits all the marks for a perfect Airbnb stay! Everything is sparkling new, clean, quiet, and their thoughtful touches made for a super relaxing, memorable experience for my weekend getaway. The bed and pullout mattress were both very comfortable, their shower is amazing, and communication was super easy (as well as their app based locking system, which was so cool, easy, and secure!). The neighborhood is quaint with lots of delicious options nearby. I highly recommend this place and can only wish that it will be available come my next visit back to Seattle! Thank you again, Tim and Michelle!"

9.05E+17,9.29E+17,,51151552,Lori,"If I could give Alyssa’s place more stars, I would! One of the best airbnb’s I’ve ever stayed at. This home is welcoming, beautiful, and so peaceful. It felt like a welcome retreat in the city. Alyssa was the most attentive and generous host I’ve had the pleasure of working with. The home had all of the special touches to make it feel just like we were in our own home. We hope to come visit again!!"
4616634,25910087,,5118936,Sue,We loved this place. It had everything we needed and felt like home. The only thing that would have made it better would be a bigger bed. (The bed is a full-size murphy bed that converts to a table.) It was quiet except for an occasional bark or two and private. Cyndy was very gracious and responsive to our needs. We felt lucky to have made such a find and hope to stay there again next visit.
13781518,86964887,,5121687,Pat,This sweet house is in a great location about 15 or 20 minute drive from all the tourist sites in Seattle so it was easy for our family and there was always parking outside. The walk to the market was super convenient so the morning coffee and fresh berry run was fun and some evenings we grabbed prepared foods there after a long day of sightseeing. The owners have obviously put a lot of effort already into renovating this house in a great neighborhood and our family of 4 really liked the room we had as opposed to a hotel room for about the same price.
18491600,172712537,,51228798,Patrick,"We had a wonderful stay at Andy's airbnb. The neighborhood is centrally located in Queen Anne. It's easy to walk to shops and restaurants. The apartment is cute and nicely furnished, and the separate door access made it feel like it was completely our own. The kitchenette was great for making our breakfasts. Andy pays attention to detail: we found lots of nice snacks and toiletries laid out for us. Highly recommend!"
8.88E+17,9.1E+17,,513081409,Dan,"My experience at Kaela’s Airbnb was fantastic. Everything was so clean and well maintained. It’s in a great location (super close to Fremont); there’s ample, free street parking; and the space is really nice and well decorated. <br/>It’s in a converted garage, but you wouldn’t really know! It’s super cute and well decorated. There’s AC and heat, too, which is great. I was staying with them during a week of wacky weather and I felt like between the two (AC and heat) the cottage cooled down or warmed up quickly. <br/>I would definitely stay here again and would recommend it to my friends."
7922663,58068751,,51351712,Maureen,"Mehrit's place was great. Everything was convenient and clean The room number 2 is very pretty, with soft sheets on the bed and a good heater that made the winter nights very comfortable. Unfortunately there was a regular noise, probably made by household appliances.<br/>If you need to be well taken care of, Mehrit and Roko are the perfect hosts for you."
13452009,82499557,,513542,Timothy,Everything was new and well appointed. Clean bright space. Great location in walking distance to some of the best food and drink Seattle has to offer. Would stay again.
9217030,55241309,,5135559,Leah,"Set the Chestnut up for my parents and this is what they said:<br/><br/>Beautifully crafted and cozy bungalo perched on hillside overlooking Seattle neighborhood. High quality interior cabinetry and workmanship. Lots of small and appreciated touches. Very peaceful neighborhood. Host thoughtful, available and accommodating. Excellent location for Seattle exploring. Would return in a heartbeat. Paul & Sarah"
49360059,4.08E+17,,51426175,Brett,"This place was really great. We stayed here with our two kids and had an amazing time. The location was absolutely perfect, and the house is close to a nearby park/playground a couple of blocks away.<br/>Such a great host and really good getaway for our family. Def coming back!"

49321835,9.53E+17,,519151615,Kasie,"The home was absolutely perfect for our stay in Seattle for six people and the hosts were incredibly helpful and responsive! Highly recommended and would definitely stay again! The home was very clean, it was fully stocked with all of the amenities, and there were notes for tips/suggestions throughout the home. There was even a thoughtful bag of local coffee for us! The location is in a nice and quiet neighborhood, and is just a short drive/Uber away from the usual tourist hotspots, such as Pikes and the Space Needle. It’s also a VERY short walk from two parks (including a splash park) which was wonderful for my son! And we loved that there was usually an open street spot to park, and if not, there was a designated stall behind the building…definitely one less thing to worry about! Overall, the home really helped make our trip great!"
6.85E+17,7.55E+17,,51931747,Molly,"Came to Seattle for work and to visit friends. My stay at Villa Del’Amore was nothing short of amazing. The property is beautiful and the energy serene - a retreat but you are in the middle of the city! I loved having coffee in the open kitchen with incredible skyline views of Seattle, the water and space needle. The bathrooms appear recently updated and felt spa like. Great bedding/linens and high quality furniture & design throughout. Took advantage of the hot tub and loved doing my yoga & meditation practice in the separate gym space. Location is awesome, upscale neighborhood that is quiet yet walking distance to excellent cafes and shops. Ivo was super easy to communicate with and place very clean. Couldn’t recommend more!"
7772661,58432301,,51968499,Nathan,"Michael & Manny made us feel right at home. Great hosts, and a cozy, comfortable, modern/minimalist space. The carriage house is located in one of Seattle's best neighborhoods, and it's quiet all night. Would love to stay again."
10569919,68161715,,52016683,Theresa,Such a great location! The condo had plenty of space and everything we needed to make it feel like home. Check in was so easy and convenient; would stay there again on my next trip to Seattle.
37657464,539136837,,52041851,Linda,"This is such a hidden gem in Magnolia! Darling cozy basement with everything you could possibly need. Private, safe, and great neighborhood. I would give them 6 stars if I could. 2 ????’s up for sure"
20696304,194962734,,52083748,Collin,Great AirBnB. It was perfect for our needs and just the right amount of space.
18348358,223122889,,52088571,Michael,"Had a wonderful stay with Grant and Ray. The room and house was very clean with very high end amenities. Grant and Ray were both very friendly and helpful in directing me on what to see in the beautiful city of Seattle. Their house is just one block from an express bus that goes into downtown and Belltown so it was a very convenient location. along with coffee shops, grocery stores, and restaurants within 2-3 blocks. I look forward to staying with them again."
12185450,71127732,,5216627,Martin,"Fantastic apartment in an ideal location. Clean, spacious, quiet, well appointed. Will definitely be coming back"
9596,315791,,522027,Michael,"The minute we step foot down the stairs of the Urban Cottage, we felt right at home. Cozy, nicely decorated with all the amenities one can ask for. Nice to look out the windows from the ""living room"" to see greenery. Urban Cottage was comfortable for the 3 of us--we were on the move, and there was room for one more! We loved the the neighborhood and the surroundings and enjoyed the easy walk down to the park. Whenever we left the cottage to go into town, we were always happy to come back and feel at home and enjoy the peacefulness. We thank you Joyce for your warm hospitality!"
14168480,9.33E+17,,52246861,Fon,"This place is very nice, it was clean, they have everything you need, close to really good restaurants, I recommend cactus!! The only issue was we could hear people stomping upstairs, it was very loud. But it was good stay overall."
9.26E+17,9.48E+17,,523266169,Anthony,"Your place is absolutely the best. Organized, clean, well stocked and comfortable. We’ve stayed at many Airbnb’s and your place thus far is top.<br/>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. Beautiful. Oh had to mention….. Awesome coffee (the whole set up). Will come again.<br/>The Portee’s"
18673405,164807051,,5240548,Rose,"My family of four had a great time staying at Shawn's home. It was super clean, quiet and very centrally located. You can walk to coffee, food, public transportation and much more. There is also an off street parking spot and driving around town from his home was easy. Shawn responded quickly throughout the whole process. I would absolutely stay here again!"
19543829,168078648,,52408243,Cesar,"Easy access, great location, clean and a great communicator. Would recommend for anyone looking to enjoy Ballard!"
24493115,271921918,,52433693,H,"The host was very hospitable and the room is super clean, bright and sunny (located on the second floor). Enjoyed everything in this place and hope to visit again! Thank you!"
27895209,313666811,,52442797,Ezi,Sayed was a wonderful host and the place was amazing!!
33224279,449893260,,52459451,Kayla M.,"Kimberley’s place was incredibly located right in the heart of Seattle. Public transportation was great and Ubers were incredibly cheap. The home itself has great space - both in the room, the living area and the big kitchen. I enjoyed having access to the kitchen to cook or store food if I needed to. When I traveled, there was unexpected construction and renovations happening in the house which didn’t make for the most peaceful stay, but I spent a lot of time out of the house and did not mind. If that is something that’s important to you, I would ask Kimberley about that before you travel. Otherwise, all was great. I’d definitely stay here again."
48017771,738362085,,5246591,Tony,"Great centralized location, and pictures accurately show the unit. Almost everything seemed brand new and I think this is new on the Airbnb market. It’s right across the street from a school but it is currently not in session so it’s fairly quite. Parking in front is restricted to 2hr but 1 block north has limited free parking. I booked an extended month long stay to WFM but quickly found out the WiFi was unstable. ISP speeds ranges from 3 to 20 mbps when it works, and will drop multiple times a day like clock work. Not fast enough for zoom calls. Cell service (Verizon) is one bar and not enough to stay connected. I understand the host added an additional WiFi extender but I checked out before i could test it. The walls are not very sound proof and I could hear the neighbors snoring. One small window that looks out to the neighboring building. No natural light at all. If you’re staying for a weekend or shorter stays and not planning on staying in and working, then this would be great place. Great value for the cap hill location! The host is professional and responds promptly but is more of a landlord than a bnb host."
40135417,602142493,,5255098,Shannon,"Tiffany's Airbnb was clean, had great views, and was close to what we needed. I highly recommend this Airbnb for families, single people, or retirees."
12343805,75435724,,52588994,Kara,"Loved staying at Alissa's loft, very quiet and peaceful. The location is great for someone who wants to be close to the city but not in the thick of downtown. Hosts helped this Seattle newcomer feel right at home. I stayed at this location for a month and I wish I could have stayed longer."
21912608,221205259,,52597622,Xufeng,"This is the place you want to stay if you are looking for a quite, clean, cozy place near DT Seattle. The hosts are very friendly and respond to messages very fast. Will book again shall I visit Seattle next time for vacation!"
13794197,84951098,,52618663,My,"It was great staying with Renee. We got everything we need (clean beds, towels, coffee, shampoo...). She was very nice and careful. The location is great, about 10 mins to downtown Seattle and very peaceful neighborhood. Our kids really enjoyed playing with Meggie (the pup pie). Thanks Renee again for her hospitality!!!"
30960947,365849155,,52801108,Linda,"We had a wonderful stay at Alice and Johnny’s place! They were there to greet us, went through the unit with us explaining everything we needed to know and left us snacks and Pellegrino in the refrigerator! The unit overlooks Lake Union and we were able to watch the Christmas ships come and go All night. The unit is well stocked and the bed AND Pillows were very comfortable!<br/>They had recommended the Westward Restaurant for our New Years Eve dinner which was literally right across the street from the unit. The food and view were incredible!<br/>We walked back across the street to watch the New Year fireworks from the Space Needle at midnight which was great!<br/>The Burke-Gilman trail is also right across the street from the unit so we took a long walk through Gas Work park to the Fremont Bridge and back. Alice recommended Irwins for breakfast and it was amazing! Alice and Johnny really know the area and where the best spots are to eat!<br/>I would highly recommend this unit for a fun Seattle stay! Thanks again Alice and Johnny for an incredible start to 2019!!"
33200897,456143854,,52803207,Michelle,"Liz is a wonderful host. We are grateful for the timely and friendly communication and the attention paid to every detail- from cleanliness to amenities. The location is perfect for anyone wanting to be close to downtown, Queen Anne, and Ballard while staying in the beautiful and peaceful neighborhood of Magnolia! Wonderful place for a walk with scenic views of the sound. We highly recommend Liz and Ryan’s home."

54222105,6.34E+17,,52998657,Jeff,"Overall good. House full of professional adults while I was there. Cookware sparse, but sufficient for basics. Room well furnished. Ran very warm, even with vent closed. Bed needed to be replaced. Rand was responsive and easy to work with. Bed aside, I'd stay again."
10295151,59017912,,53041238,Ken,This property is a terrific base for activities in the best spots in Seattle. We were warmly welcomed by the courteous and accommodating staff. I would return anytime and recommend without hesitation.
46166272,9.68E+17,,530593823,Wendy,This home is perfect for a large group or family. We enjoyed our stay very much and will definitely return next time we stay in Seattle. ??
19764464,310686930,,5320425,Glen,"Brad's place was beyond our expectations. We had plenty of room for me and my brothers who came to visit Seattle from LA to see family and catch the Dodgers Mariners series. There was so much room to lounge and relax on the outdoor patio and balcony areas. Brad was an excellent host. He's a well travelled man and he gave great city tips and recs. We all loved the personal touches like snack bars, wine, coffee that he provided to make us feel very at home. His sound system throughout the house was really cool and the entry access was very easy too! I would highly recommend staying here at Brad's spot as it's also in a really good central area in the Capitol Hill neighborhood where we were able to walk and uber everywhere we needed to go with ease!"
50215286,9.49E+17,,53231288,Ye,"H's place is clean, beautifully set up, super spacious, and perfectly equipped with all the amenities! The backyard offers a wonderful view of sunrise, and the ambient light sets up a great atmosphere for enjoying the summer breeze and tranquility of a relaxing evening. My wife and I spent a week there and enjoyed every second!"
8290643,62605966,,53348343,Thomas,"Priscilla's place was very nice! My partner and I arrived later in the evening, but Priscilla made it easy for us to make ourselves at home. It's not a huge place, but fine for two people. The space is clean, open, everything is functional; Priscilla put out some shampoo and conditioner for us to use which was really nice, so we didn't have to use our own; towels were available for us; wipes to clean anything; soap and sponge to do some dishes; everything was set up for us to be comfortable. The bed is a real bed, comfortable for two; the shower is not big, big enough to two people to fit inside; there are two closets with hangers available; also a TV if you're feelin that. The space feels private and separated, which is nice if you're trying to get away. It was raining/cloudy while we were there (Seattle) so we didn't use the cute table out back, but there's a nice little table with two chairs available. No view, but a nice little private area with a hill and plants nearby. Oh, there's also a heater in the bathroom, super nice! And a gas fireplace that serves as the heater, also very nice and warm. Romantic and cute feel, a nice way to explore the Fremont area. Highly recommend! And a good price too, thank you Priscilla!"
27369320,306547516,,5352925,Jesse,Quiet building on a quiet street about a mile from the city center very walkable. Clean space. The bed is really close to the ceiling and it can be challenging getting down from the top bunk.
12609601,199988067,,53790405,Amelyn,"This Airbnb is by far one of the most affordable and yet still beautiful places I’ve stayed. Parking was never a problem as well. The hot tub was an added bonus and nice for a cold night. Michael was very easy to get in touch with so if we ever needed anything or had concerns he was there to help. Restaurants in the nearby area were also very good! If you want to visit some cool bars and restaurants, it is a very short drive to Fremont."
33856812,439838692,,53834183,Nichole,Kathleen’s place was wonderful! I was greeted by Kathleen and her mother and shown around the house. The house was sparkling clean and bed was very comfortable. I throughly enjoyed my conversations with Kathleen’s mother. Wonderful room and amazing hospitality. I’d stay again in a heart beat. Thank you!
8410028,62717441,,53862460,Thomas,"Cathy made our stay in Seattle so fantastic, this review won't do it justice! We arrived to a clean, well kept apartment, with a detailed guide to her home (TV, internet, washing machine, etc) and lots of suggestions on things to see, eat, and have fun doing in the area. Her apartment is very centrally located and we were able to walk to almost everything we wanted to do - unless it was raining, and then it was all a quick and cheap Uber ride away. (Things like the Starbucks Reserve Roastery, Nordstrom Flagship Store, and Convention Center are only a couple blocks walking distance. Pike Place Market is about 10 minutes walking downhill.) She left snacks and some juices and water in the fridge for us - we felt like we were truly welcome guests in her home. The queen size bed is very comfortable, and the pullout couch was perfect for our friends. We didn't use them, but she left plenty of drawer and closet space for clothing in the bedroom. Fresh, clean towels and a variety of individual-use toiletries in the bathroom were available for us to use. I'd highly recommend booking her apartment if you're going to Seattle, you'll have a great time and feel just like you're staying with a friend - so much more comfortable than staying in a hotel!"
22808109,241343510,,53907531,Nicole,Everything were good
10459203,59733503,,53959852,Meryl,"This place was even better than the description. This is a perfect location – it is very close to University Village for great shopping and dining; close to the University of Washington; and with easy access to public transportation to go quickly to all the sights downtown. There are great parks and walking trails near-by. <br/><br/>I highly recommend staying here! Teresa and Rick were exceptional and provided me with such warm hospitality. They gave me information that made everything smooth and easy. They knew the neighborhood and the city very well and provided me with lots of great recommendations for restaurants, sight-seeing, shopping cultural and recreational events."
9907337,66917764,,54154716,Williamson,"We enjoyed our stay at this lovely place that is newly renovated. The place is very clean. It has everything we need, clean towels, washer dryer, coffee maker, cooktop and oven, and all the utensils. Like a home away from home.<br/><br/>The Host Don is very responsive to every inquiry we made. The place is conveniently located away from the downtown Seattle traffic, yet convenient to drive anywhere a tourist will want to visit. Restaurants and coffee shops are walking distance away. It is right by the Green Lake where one can jog or walk any time of the day. We saw people even jogging at night with their visor headlamp or joggers lamp.<br/><br/>This is a place where we'll definitely rent again when we visit Seattle area.<br/>"
42066420,617106301,,54161828,Christina,"The apartment was perfect while I visited my daughter at UW. There is plenty of room, it is clean, comfortable and I felt safe. The location is super convenient and Sandy and Mark were great communicators and very welcoming. I’ll be back for sure."

841274,3921684,,5417958,Jodi,"Loved Goat Hill, and Gucci. Jill was a wonderful host and the apt was quiet and comfortable. The atmosphere with the goats and chickens was super. No noise or odor from them. It was a wonderful haven in a stressful time. Jodi"
6376139,79535645,,5419327,Cade & Ana,Zach's place is wonderful. He really went all out with his space. It's like staying in a high end condo. Location is perfect for cool restaurants and bars nearby or for going down to the market. He was more than accommodating and very comminicative. Highly recommended without a doubt.
23273138,311215209,,5419502,Ben,This is a fantastic place! It was well furnished and seemed brand new. Lynne left a bottle of wine and a bag of treats on the table which impressed us very much.
42414204,6.36E+17,,5430946,Lukas,"We had a great stay at the apartment. It has all the things that you need for a comfortable stay. We especially enjoyed the living room, kitchen and rooftop terrace a lot. However, the apartment only had two real bedrooms. The third bedroom was at the front door and separated by a blanket."
25585275,277589905,,5435221,Obed,this place is very comfy. Melissa is very kind and very responsive. the studiois well equipped with everything you'd need for your stay and very well located. I highly recommend it to any one!
11573287,95675061,,54398462,Victor,"Martha welcomed us into her home for an extended period and took great care of us. We felt like we were at home. It was a little rough working out the details for the longer term rent, but once we figured it out, things worked out fairly smooth."
1976382,10435841,,5452140,Jesse,"A beautiful apartment that was very convenient to the rest of town. Autumn was great - stayed up late to let us in after a really late flight.<br/><br/>Would definitely stay again!"
18119556,168954959,,5453574,Bryant,"I arranged my reservation to accommodate my and my fiancé's parents, and it was a very accesible and comfortable stay for all of them. Zero complaints. I'd highly recommend this listing, especially if you're trying to find a place that can easily accommodate a car."
22911160,423319265,,54558347,Hakim,I stayed at this Airbnb for 6 months. My experience was absolutely amazing. The condo was incredibly clean and very well furnished. The view is breath taking. The apartment was filled with all the possible amenities anyone could need. Toni was super nice and very responsive. She even gave me a lot of recommendations about Seattle when I first moved in. I would absolutely recommend staying here.
27909830,318491889,,54566546,Perry,Very nice cleaning suite! Great location close to everything in Seattle and very reasonable rate.
565703,3922569,,5467361,Quynh,"Bright, cheerful, and relaxing! This garden apartment with private entrance is exactly as pictured, offering peace and comfort. Ron truly is a generous and gracious host."
16619811,131788032,,54707953,Jasmin Minah,I stayed in here 3days with my friends. Karin was really kind and makes us comfortable. Location is perfect. I could went public market 3times. If I have opportunity go to Seattle I will go Karin's house! Thank you :)
42004276,625276799,,547125,José María Rodríguez Valadez,"Pedro and Hector were very helpful and available during my stay. The apartment is comfortable, very centrally located, and was perfect for my trip. Planning to stay here in my future visits to Seattle. Thank you!"
25188308,273055220,,5488095,Laina,"Melissa's listing is in a really great spot, central and close to everything in the UW area. That does mean it's a bit noisy outside at times, so I'd recommend earplugs. The accomodations were a bit lacking - the bed was very firm, the couch unusable(broken springs you sank into the wood frame), one of the lamps is unusable(there is no overhead lighting in main room, so lamps are key), the fridge was very noisy at times, and the building overall is old and not well maintained.<br/>If you stay here, know that location is what you're getting and expect hostel quality accommodations otherwise. If you reserve with those expectations, you should be satisfied."
20544121,267752066,,54990397,Kevin,"I enjoyed staying at Lorraine’s place. It is in a very beautiful, quiet neighborhood with great views of Puget Sound. Lorraine is very nice and checked in with me several times during my stay to ask if I needed anything. I used the bus and Lyft (and light rail from the airport to downtown) instead of renting a car and that worked OK; some people would want to have a car. I could walk to some stores and restaurants within 15-20 minutes. It can be a little chilly in this space so bring a sweatshirt etc. Lorraine also has two space heaters that I did not test out too much. Overall, I would recommend staying here."
38334917,550493757,,55021955,Kevin,"Super cool property. Very nice interior, sparkling clean and comfortable. Amazing huge tub in downstairs bathroom as well as a two person ;) shower upstairs. The roof deck was very nice! The early morning sunrises and the evening city lights views are really cool. Definitely looking for this spot when we book again in Seattle! Thanks Sherry and Team for a spectacular stay!!"
21170317,215271851,,55041516,Marissa,"My family and I are scattered all over, and decided Seattle would be the best place to meet up. This space was absolutely wonderful! The house is beautiful and the area is so adorable! We were literally right across the street from a Safeway that was open 24/7, and tons of fabulous restaurants, bars, etc. <br/>Highly recommend this house! Will hopefully be back soon."

677365,236182414,,55067462,Michele,Luke and Jamie's place was wonderful! It's gorgeous inside and we will definitely be back! I highly recommend! Only 15-20 minutes from the heart of Seattle.
16816051,310585663,,55304237,Alejandra,This was a spectacular location for our corporate retreat. I could not have asked for a more communicative host or more well equipped house for entertaining and overnight guests. Would recommend and would stay again!
13332139,81147830,,55327315,Nicole,Very clean and comfortable place for my family to stay. Quiet location near all the action. We were very pleased and would rent again from Joe anytime.
19229958,166573597,,5534973,Michelle,"A lovely cozy studio that's extremely well decorated. The sofa bed was comfy and Hailey and Dave were really helpful. It was a nice and quiet neighborhood right near the zoo, and adjacent to all of the Phinney Ridge goodness. Wonderful stay!"
34912079,480875750,,5556887,Vinay,"I loved my 1 week stay here. The cottage is in a very central area of Queen Anne and I enjoyed walking to all the establishments nearby. And yet, once you're back it's ultra quiet. There's plenty of parking as well. Highly recommended!!"

20189433,200834965,,55597175,Corey,"The location is great. It is 5 Miles from downtown Seattle, so you’re right there at Seattle without having to stay in the heart of downtown. The place is super quiet and has great amenities. West Seattle offers a wide variety of unique restaurants, pubs, bars, etc. If I make a return trip to Seattle in the future I would love to stay at Elaine’s place again!"
11512414,67225502,,55661984,Benjamin,Great place! Nice location! All daily needs satisfied as well for a pretty good price. Nice host as well
3739681,16879173,,5576024,Shelley,"The apartment was in a great location, close to good restaurants and downtown. The neighborhood was very pleasant, with good architecture and plenty of parking. The apartment was quiet and welcoming. There were plenty of windows, despite the fact that it is a basement apartment."
12798217,79524715,,55842698,Patti,"We had a wonderful experience with Elaine and David's accommodations. The Christmas light walkway was very nice and welcoming, along with the ice water and the chalkboard welcome sign. The space is well appointed, spacious, clean and cozy. The bathroom is gorgeous. The patio was as beautiful and relaxing and it looks in the picture. Very nice couple. We look forward to going back."

49011550,750847302,,56099867,Jessica,"I wanted to book a couple of days alone to re-calibrate after a particularly challenging few months, and let me just say I am so GLAD that I ended up here.<br/>Talk about a hidden gem!<br/>This farmhouse literally overlooks the city and the view of the mountains from the wrap around deck was everything I needed in the mornings. The location was basically a couple blocks away from the freeway entrance, and so close to restaurants and stores. The space is so well laid out and functional, and the kitchen, living room and office nook were nicer than most boutique hotels I’ve stayed in. The WiFi was fast, and combined with a strong cup of coffee and good lighting, I was able to knock out all of my work in the nook while there, and even picked up some fresh ingredients in the area so I could test out the snazzy kitchen and make myself a fancy dish. I spent the afternoons either playing with Linda and Max (goats on premises ya’ll!), or sipping wine with a good book and a view on the deck. <br/>It was a charming, and comfortable experience. And I so appreciated Luke’s responsiveness and good communication before and during the stay. This was everything I needed, and I cannot wait for an excuse to come back."
23409619,273628809,,56142939,Jeans,"Britt is a great host, I lost my key and she took 25 minutes to deliver the key to me at night. Thank u very much. The house was decorated tasty. Only problem is closed to the airport with big noisy of plane."

It was nicely decorated and has a nice enclosed front yard for doggies. You are steps away from great restaurants, stores , beach,with a beautiful view of Seattle. You will love it!"

45532820,705468180,,5652209,Dmytro,"Great location: near University of Washington, and near the Burke-Gilman jogging/biking trail, 5 min walk to QFC and Safeway supermarkets. Melissa was super nice and helpful, and responded almost instantly. The roommates were really nice guys. There is a comfortable backyard, and parking on backyard was possible for additional price."
1157083,5277248,,5652767,William,"Grace was a great host. My flight came in a little bit late on Friday night, but she met me at the Elektra, walked me through and showed me all the details. The main elevators are being renovated, so only one was working, but there is a freight elevator (its actually nicer inside than the main elevator). The freight elevator only goes to the 4th floor (and above) but the back door of the building is on the 4th floor, and closer to Pike and the convention center than the front door. The apartment was well appointed and very comfortable. A colleague and I used the apartment as a base during a conference at the convention center, about a 3 minutes walk, and there was plenty of room for both of us."
48079334,733542152,,56668733,Max,"We loved our stay at Shannon’s home! The 86” 4K TV and huge couch was amazing to relax and watch movies. The sauna was nice as was the bath, heated floors, and all the other fancy upgrades :) The location was great too!"
18414350,149746917,,56782913,Mike,"The owners were AWESOME!<br/>They greeted me upon my arrival and were very friendly.<br/>The ""business bungalow"" is impeccably clean, well furnished and outfitted for your stay. <br/>The special ground coffee was amazing with the additional extras left for my enjoyment.<br/>More than a Diamond in the rough.... more like an affordable Ritz in the City....<br/>Highly recommend ????????????<br/>"
30234326,591637902,,5686928,Michelle,"This is a great studio! The entire process from quick and helpful communication with Lyle, ease of check-in and check-out, cleanliness of the place, amenities and fine touches provided in the studio, and convenient location — everything was great and perfect for my needs. Highly recommend. Thank you, Lyle and Maynard!"
13846894,113398765,,5696585,Thomas Charles,Tanya was incredibly welcoming and helpful from the moment I booked this room. She welcomed me like family and the room was everything we had hoped for and more. Location was amazing. The snacks were amazing. I'd highly recommend staying with Tanya if you get the chance.
18215078,159338283,,56994600,Paul,"This is a wonderful place to stay. The place has all you want including a refrigerator, microwave, comfortable bed, and a great shower. Dina is a great host, and is extremely helpful (even received some half & half for my coffee!). The location is even better. A short walk over a foot bridge and you were right on Lake Washington. Beautiful. A great place to stay and very reasonable. Thanks Dina!"
17878829,162629981,,57032385,Jeff,"Awesome stay. Close to everything. Very easy to get to, and Chris and Maria were easy to deal with. Great stay, I'd definitely stay again."

7697340,43172005,,5733285,Praful,"We were the first guests for this wonderful place with a fantastic host. Lovely new modern house in East Lake. Patio on the roof has gorgeous views of the lake and Seattle skyline. The house is very tastefully furnished with all the modern touches. Ruby is an absolutely fantastic host. Ruby provided very detailed and helpful information of the house and the area, and was very responsive when we had questions. Would highly recommend to my friends. Thanks Ruby."
12786096,77701433,,57458578,Kelly,Great neighborhood. Clean and cute apartment. Very pleased overall.
9234966,94922821,,57459021,Emily,Everything was perfect! We could not have found a better place to stay! The place is updated and clean and the neighborhood is very family friendly. Green lake is beautiful and within walking distance. We really appreciated the privacy of the space but how accommodating and accessible Moira was. When I told her we'd be traveling with my 18-month-old she offered to provide a pack and play and a highchair and access to her children's toys. We will definitely be staying there again!
11743748,69359359,,57461593,Tracy,Christie made everything ready for us and we felt welcome. We are the first to stay at this great suite. The view is lovely at night. There were a few glitches but all in all a comfortable place to put your feet up after a long day. Its a good base to explore the city.
13252771,95905577,,57570738,Wesley,"The apartment looked like it did in the picture and was in a pretty nice location. The owner was attentive, easy to contact, and quick to respond to any concerns."
19640055,167748266,,57914242,Victor,"Nice room, Uber/lyft is cheap to get to downtown or pike area. Bus stop is very close to her place, would stay here again."
52131716,6.06E+17,,57967478,John,Great location! Easy street parking every day in a small quiet building. Fantastic coffee right across the road and great places to eat and drink within a 5 min walk.<br/>Bedroom is roomy and the bed comfortable. Good linens and towels. Kitchen is reasonably well appointed but be aware that the dishwasher and countertop cooking elements are small and the only oven is the combo microwave/convection. Not a huge deal but a little inconvenient if you are cooking regularly. <br/>Enjoyed my stay and would stay again.
1159111,5016171,,5797848,Dee,"Christine was very responsive to my questions prior to my stay. The apt was clean, comfy, and centrally located to the happenings in the area and my business location. I would stay again."

4025954,19449422,,5825506,Amy,"This was the perfect place for us for a couple of quiet days away! James was an attentive and communicative host who gave us plenty of helpful tips for enjoying the neighborhood. The place was quiet, clean, and just felt like home, with coffee and tea and a basket of fresh fruit on the table. Steps away from beautiful Green Lake and an easy bus ride to downtown Seattle. We loved it!"
42796054,624616890,,58340315,Whitney,"Marissa & Ed were awesome hosts! Quick responses and always looking for solutions! We rented long-term as travel nurses and they were flexible with unforeseen events which caused me to have to leave a month early. Very clean, modern, and neat!! Also a great location with some amazing views of Seattle."
15790340,116807271,,58371958,Deanna,This place is amazing. It so conveniently located and a wonderful place to come back to after a day of being out and about. The accomidations were cozy yet still spacious for 4 people. One of my favorite things about this place was the rooftop. It is a beautiful place to see the city.
17937341,148473121,,58388131,Victoria,"The carriage house made for a fantastic stay. It was well equipped with everything we could have possibly needed, right down to the wine bottle opener. Absolutely the most comfortable bed in the history of beds! In fact, everything about the place was downright cozy. It was great to come back from a day of sightseeing, to sit and relax in front of the electric fireplace. The house itself was simply gorgeous -- we were impressed with the high end finishes throughout. We will definitely plan to stay again the next time we visit Seattle."
40678367,597099085,,58415847,Blair,"This place was clean, cozy, and newly remodeled. The apartment was blocks away from great restaurants, a convenience store and a bus line that went directly downtown. The hosts hosts were great and I would highly recommend."

36073318,489974260,,58583740,Karen,This space is unique and beautiful in a quiet little corner of Seattle away from the hustle and bustle of downtown. Courtney included such thoughtful touches in the space and I felt very taken care of. Would absolutely stay here again in the future.
13436253,110823469,,58689290,Shane,"OVERVIEW: Have any of you ever stayed at a REAL ""Bed and Breakfast,"" through the Air B&B service? I mean, the kind you used to read about in rustic Travel brochures where they actually cook for you and stuff? Well, this one's even better than that.<br/><br/>Accuracy: ABSOLUTE - Flor takes the accuracy of her presentation VERY seriously, and it's never lacking. I recommend the room with the masks, if you're travelling alone - it's called the ""European"" room, and certainly lives-up to its reputation!<br/><br/>Cleanliness: Housekeeper that works daily - she vacuums, re-stocks the mini-fridges that are in every room, empties the trash, and on top of it all, is<br/>very friendly to speak with!<br/><br/>Arrival: I know for a fact, both from firsthand AND secondhand<br/>experience, that Flor takes the arrival experience of every single<br/>guest EXTREMELY seriously; during my original extended-stay, she happily reschedule her day's activities, just to accommodate a change in the arrival-times of her guests. It is amazing. Expect a tour of the house, a fun little backstory<br/>regarding how it got its name, and an amazing interior display - she has Turtles!<br/><br/>Amenities: Like I said: Mini-fridge (not even small) that is ALWAYS fully-stocked when you first arrive, and re-stocked daily to your personal satisfaction.<br/><br/>WORTH the price on that alone. Every room comes with its own Towels<br/>(more than you'll get in an Hotel room, I guarantee that! More than I got when<br/>I even stayed at the Warwick, downtown... and that's $360.00/night..)<br/><br/>Each room comes with a basket containing all the toiletries you will need, just in-case you forget your toothpaste (which I did), and plenty of small cooking/dining supplies such as salt, pepper, plates, napkins, mugs, Sugar and silverware – so you can make the most of that microwave which is included in each room as well.<br/><br/>Location: As if all that wasn't good enough, you CAN'T BEAT the location! There's a QFC (all-night grocery) JUST around the corner, definitely within walking-distance; you'll pass a Steak and Egg joint (Patty's) along the way, which apparently was named the “Best Breakfast in Seattle,” or so the sign says (I don't know – by the time I wakeup, they're usually done serving breakfast but another guest said it was great).<br/><br/>I'm not making this up – there's even a freaking Little Caesars just across from that main shopping area!<br/><br/>And the best part – the D-line! It will take you all the way down, to experience the best parts of our fair city and if you endup having too much fun, don't worry! On the way back, at least at the time of this review (and no foreseeable plans to change it, to my knowledge) it's last stop is – guess where? RIGHT behind the same QFC... so there's NO way you'll be able to miss your stop, as a tourist. Yeah, it's Fantastic.<br/><br/>OVERALL: I'm changing the name of this place: it's now the SIX-Star house, Flor! Thank you, Everybody :-)"
13533362,80546888,,58785534,Melinda,"<br/>This is my first Airbnb experience and it was great! Everything was exactly as described. This place was nice and very quite. The room was spacious, clean and had a comfortable mattress and pillows. <br/>The location was perfect for my stay; only few minutes from UW, local coffee shops and restaurants. Overall a very comfortable stay!"
904057,3585290,,587956,Steven,The cottage was very modern and cool. Perfect for my needs and Errin was great. This is a good jumping off point for Ballard restaurant and coffee shop ++ scene and Shilshole touring and excellent transportation downtown. Huge deck and hot tub are a plus for warmer months.
46548051,712020752,,58796419,Oscar,Great place to stay!
1048798,4298006,,5880131,Craig,"You must stay at this property!!! The home and the view are even more gorgeous than the pictures show. Sitting at the kitchen table or in the living room gave me a 180 degree view of the islands and the ferries crossing the sound. The house is incredibly well stocked and organized, and the owners are so nice and friendly. The neighborhood is very quite; the house sits on a small dead end road. However, in spite of the privacy and the view, this home is so close to Seattle and business. I am staying here every time I can. The best property I have found in the US yet!<br/><br/>"
14798986,5.64E+17,,5884790,Jed,"Place is great! Loaded with amenities, appreciated all the bottled water, smart TVs, luxury bedding, all new appliances like washer and dryer."

11697817,90754520,,59072131,Phillip,"We had a great time staying at Drew's property. We stayed here for a couple months while on a work assignment. The house had nearly everything we needed. The house was quiet, clean, and the location was great. There are multiple restaurants, grocery stores, and shops all within walking distance. Additionally, you can get on the highway to go to downtown Seattle very easily. Alki beach is about 10 minute drive away. The house has a pretty patio area that feels private. The neighborhood felt very safe with many families and young kids riding bikes on the streets. I would recommended staying here whether for a long term stay or for short weekend trip to Seattle. Communication with host was always quick."
23702901,273627459,,59233632,Tam,"It’s super stylish, clean, great customer service."
10949926,63296749,,59252077,Nikolai,"I loved my stay at Eliza's apartment! Very nice Host, great Apartment and super Location! First of all, I want to mention easy and prompt communication with the Host. Apartment was as described and even more. Everything in it is new and very clean. Kitchen is very well stocked. Fast Internet. I also really appreciated a good night sleeps as the bed was just right.<br/>I had business downtown and was able to take a bus there as the bus stop is a half block away from the apartment. It was great to avoid the hassle and cost of driving a car and parking in the city! <br/>As a bonus, there are multiple coffee shops, restaurants and a grocery store(Whole Foods) within a block or short walk. By the way, Macrina Bakery has very nice selection of baked goods! As everything was very convenient, it gave me enough time to finish up my business and enjoy the city! Will definitely recommend this host and the apartment. Great experience, thank you Eliza!<br/>"
2197168,10045530,,593308,Dana,"This was indeed a delightful cottage near the light rail. We really enjoyed staying there, it was comfy, accessible, and a pleasant stay. We highly recommend it."
11421714,64186306,,59342276,Erin,Amy was quiet and very kind. She gave me a quick tour of the space and the building's facilities and was easy to contact. She'd also filled the guest room with lots of info packets about Seattle and its sights!
47204529,738418511,,59361038,Lauren,"Eva's place was an absolute dream! My family & I have never been so comfortable in an AirBnb. The check in process was so easy, parking right out front. Key-less entry, and a Ring security system which made me feel so safe. Heated concrete on the first floor!! Bedrooms were on the 1st and 3rd floors, each room was spacious, extremely comfortable beds, we all had our own bathrooms, letting us all be able to relax and enjoy our time there. The master bathroom has the best waterfall shower, perfect way to end a long day. The 2nd floor living space is wide open with a huge Internet capable TV & crazy fast WiFi, welcoming lots of light in the mornings, fresh air when we opened the windows & a beautiful kitchen that anyone would love to cook in! My family & I enjoyed our time so much, we ended up extending our stay a few extra days & Eva was so accommodating, and we were lucky this place was still available! I would 10/10 stay here again!"
2471659,17383454,,5950681,Susan,"I loved staying here. The house is composed of many repurposed elements in a very artistic and creative way. Everything was well thought out to make the stay very comfortable. Super clean, fridge stocked with cold drinks, coffee and french coffee press! Beautiful cross breeze in bedroom with windows open. Amazing efficient table fans..(they don't make them like that anymore). Dishwasher, washer and dryer, all of which I didn't use but nice to know they were there. A close walk to the airlink station and also a close walk to Columbia City. The bed super comfortable and the bathroom was great! I will always try to stay here when in Seattle."
25551802,295092888,,5952037,Nate,"Larissa was very helpful and attentive to any questions or needs I had. Her new unit is very stylish and has and Amazing view of downtown and the Space Needle from the big windows that look out over the city. It’s also walking distance to everything I was interested in and a short car ride to downtown. <br/>The only slightly negative thing I can think of is the walls in the kitchen and bedroom are shared walls with back of their house, so a little noise traveled, but not much. <br/>All in all, a great place to stay!"
26138712,285814935,,5955843,Priya,"I had a great stay at Wendy's place. The apartment was in a great neighborhood close to downtown and I really appreciated the additional touches, like coffee and extra toiletries."

38455132,555623426,,59643981,Ivonne,Our hosts were accommodating in every sense of the word. They were prompt with their responses and helpful from the very beginning. They had everything we needed from toiletries to towels. It’s a gorgeous place with so much natural lighting. And if that’s not enough the location will be enough to convince you. We’d come back again in a heartbeat!
7.84E+17,9.02E+17,,59672885,Matthew,"We had a great stay here. The beds were super comfy and we enjoyed hanging out on the private rooftop. Being so close to the light rail was a huge plus and made it easy to explore the city, but there was also a lot within walking distance. Would definitely come back and visit again!"
5525073,39521893,,597045,Jason,"Great place! Large apartment and really nice value. Very quiet block with plenty of parking, and you'll have a visitor permit which is a lifesaver! Nice tv area and fireplace. Super comfortable bed too!"
32089743,4.19E+17,,59760607,Topher,"This was a great find - the host was very responsive and flexible. My gf and I were looking for a long-term stay for the summer and couldn't have hoped for a better place to stay - right along lake washington and the burk gilman bike trail, a couple miles from UW and a great space in a friendly neighborhood. Would definitely come back here for another extended stay"
14902204,111790156,,59804269,Evan,"This cottage was beyond amazing! The amenities were wonderful and the ambience and atmosphere were very welcoming. Bev & Grant go above and beyond to make you feel welcome and to help you enjoy your stay. The Ballard area is so alive and bustling with activity, yet this cozy neighborhood was a nice place to sit back and relax as well. All other nearby Seattle attractions are close by and minutes away. Hosts are there if you need, with just a message or call away. They left a binder with ALL the information you need, so very helpful. I can't say enough good things about this listing, you won't go wrong with choosing Bev & Grant's Cottage. We will definitely return to stay here again!"
24698751,270287383,,5983482,John,This was a lovely home with lots of space. We loved the waterfall that spills into the natural and deep hot tub. We were able to tie our boat right on the dock. The lawn was great for yard games and they even had a smoker/BBQ. The kitchen was great for cooking while still interacting with guests in the open concept space. We would stay here again and recommend the space
12999766,81456037,,5992629,Donna,"Lisa and Desirae were very accommodating and so helpful! The communication was wonderful - no troubles at all and things couldn't have been nicer. The location was great, and transportation was easy... lots of good things to say!"
6.23E+17,8.21E+17,,59939062,Brittany,Mairtini was a great host. The property was exactly as listed and there were plenty of amenities to help you feel at home. Parking can be a little tricky on the street but its nice that the listing is so close to the light rail.
50048349,765196564,,59953041,Michaela,10/10 will be back! Anytime I’m in town I’ll be looking to see if this place is available!
12625278,72397480,,59963643,Jessica,Patrice's place is simple and nice. The room is ideal for single traveler. The apartment has a Convenient location with grocery stores and restaurants. Would recommend for traveling.
18527372,151421105,,600841,Roger,Sherry's place is very clean and modern and conveniently located near some of the liveliest neighborhoods in Seattle like Capitol Hill. I loved being able to walk down to the International District to get dinner and admiring all the local craftsmen homes in the area. Sherry was a gracious host who offered everything a guest would need to stay comfortable in her home.
21472412,223106472,,60111295,Benj,"We had a fabulous stay at Amy's cottage. The great layout made the unit feel even more spacious than it was, with stylish and dedicated space for sleeping, hanging out during the day, eating, etc. The kitchen is well-stocked with dishes and pans and also spices and condiments, which made food prep easy too, for those times we just wanted to curl up at ""home."" Amy made check-in easy and was also accessible and responsive to a couple small issues that came up while we were there. Thanks, Amy!"
25206065,279476362,,60165751,Cheryl,"Easy peasy! Great location, FAST communication, great experience."

49798584,4.23E+17,,60383950,Rachel,"Incredible studio in a great location - walking distance to amazing restaurants, coffee shops and Kerry Park. This thoughtfully curated space is a great spot for exploring the city or day trips beyond Seattle. I instantly felt at home here!"
10054747,111795671,,60397321,Nikolaos,"First things first: Susan and Jeff were excellent hosts. Polite, helpful and discreet. Then a few things about the place: the Library, as they call it, is a cozy studio in the basement. Clean, functional, just as they said it would be. Ideal for people like us who just needed a base to explore the city. The neighborhood is beautiful and quiet. Parking our car outside the house was easy. We took the bus to go down town. Bus stop was literally one minute away from our doorstep. <br/>If we ever return to Seattle we will definitely opt for Susan and Jeff's place!<br/>"
12850858,108137168,,60679875,Erin,"What a great place to call home for a week! The house was well appointed and perfectly located to walk into Magnolia village and to local parks. All the amenities - shampoo and conditioner in the bathrooms, coffee and pancake mix in the kitchen, etc. - were a generous, helpful touch. We will definitely reach out to Debra to stay here again."
303277,867025,,607714,Natnaal,"The place was wonderful and in a great location. Kara's place was really clean and it was also a perfect size place for me and my friend. There is a great view of the water from her huge private balcony. The kitchen is filled with all of the necessary utensils needed during a short stay (no pots or pans). She provided towels, clean sheets and one of the rooms even had an electric blanket (the blankets were amazing!). She also left adequate close and storage space for my stay. There is a washer and dryer in the unit which is very convenient. The shower has plenty of hot water, which can be very helpful during the colder months in Seattle. Also there is no cable TV, but I was able to hook up my laptop using an HDMI cord and watch movies during my downtime. There wasn't any WiFi at the time but it didn't take too much away from my stay. There are a couple of stores, restaurants within walking distance. Eastlake is also just a few minutes away from downtown and a few minutes away from the University of Washington campus. Overall, I had a great stay and I would definitely recommend the place."
21203818,269667744,,6079510,Isabel,"It was a pleasure to stay in Wendy’s home for one month. She was the loveliest host and her home is beautiful. Communication ran smoothly from start to finish, with super quick responses from Wendy. Checkin and checkout was easy. Her home was very clean, the bedroom had everything a guest would need (hairdryer, iron, dresser, closet, comfy bed and nice bed linens) and the location was excellent. I am giving Wendy 5 stars for everything and I would highly recommend her home. Thank you for everything, Wendy!"
20520544,199381940,,6080161,Matthew,"Lee was a fantastic host, super attentive and helpful! His place was very nice and very comfortable to stay in. I highly recommend it!"
14187192,92128146,,6088797,Larry,"John and his place: top notch. Good communication. Clean, comfortable lodgings. A-1"
54140410,6.31E+17,,6097506,Jeff,"Beautiful luxury townhouse in a great location in the heart of Alki. Super close to Alki beach and restaurants, but just far enough away to feel quiet and private. Also very close to Whale Tail Park. Lots of high end items like: remote blinds, adjustable bed, rain shower, heated bathroom floors, rooftop deck and more. Great kitchen with very nice appliances."
9448215,56349855,,6101202,Andre,"Savannah was a great host - she welcomed me and showed me around her place, gave me WiFi access and told me about the neighborhood. Thank you for a pleasant stay :)"
22131341,219921186,,61103436,Cameron,Lovely place exactly like the photos. Super comfy and cozy. We really enjoyed our stay!
24728697,269706928,,61122131,Victoria,"This house was very clean, comfortable and cute! Lots of thoughtful touches and amenities. The location and neighborhood was great. Would definitely stay again!"
11462832,64495046,,61423739,Tom,"I did not know what to expect as this was my first ABnB experience. I have to say, it was perfect and exceeded my expectations. The communication was great, the process was simple and the garden room was beautiful. clean and delightful."
38905208,543496100,,61437707,Jeremiah,"We were blown away by how nice all the furnishings were and the decorations. Tons of amenities from fruit to coffee to different creamers and the chocolate and popcorn was a very nice touch. There was so much more that we could have spent the weekend inside and still have a great time. We like to do and see a lot when we visit new places and this location put us close to everything while being far enough away from the main city part. While where we stayed was part of her home we had our own access to our area and felt like we had the place to ourselves. She was quick to respond and give recommendations. So far, the best AirBnB experience!"
6336564,9E+17,,6145035,Jennifer,"Very nice unit in a great, walkable neighborhood with lots of restaurants and shops near by, as well as easy parking and great access to bus lines. The apartment is clean and large, and has everything you'd need for a stay in Seattle. The neighborhood is absolutely beautiful and Genevieve was a great host (even put a beach towel out for me when I mentioned I wanted to do some swimming while in Seattle). Would definitely stay here again. As mentioned in the description, the unit is in the basement so you can hear the family upstairs at times but it didn't bother me - just something to know!"
12708859,78017568,,61456356,Danielle,"This was the perfect place to stay during our trip to Seattle! It was very convenient to the airport and not far from all of the sights we wanted to see. The place was immaculately clean and comfortable. There was a walk-in closet with lots of shelving to unload luggage so the living space did not feel cramped or cluttered. The beds were comfortable and the yard was very pretty. There was also everything you would need to make small meals and coffee in the morning. The accommodations exceeded my expectations. I took a nice walk around the neighborhood in the morning and it was lovely. Jennifer was very welcoming and responsive to questions, while we had plenty of privacy. I highly recommend staying here and plan to come back on my next trip to Seattle."
11525992,166548378,,6147352,Kerb,"I don't often use the word perfect, but sheesh it's hard not to when thinking back to our stay at Maria's house. We had everything we needed and then some. The layout of the place is so, so special. Air, light, and music just flow here. We enjoyed the roomy backyard, colorful living room, and warm front deck. It's a classic, iconic Seattle home. And that record collection!<br/>The house is supremely quiet with much more activity just five blocks away. North Fremont is a special neighborhood in Seattle -- tiny, equipped, and colorful."
2396734,11246896,,6152081,Shelly,"This two bedroom condo in Ballard is a delightful and accommodating space outfitted with all you need for you stay. It is close to two great streets for shopping, including casual cafes and fine dining, grocery, books, etc.<br/><br/>Mario was a terrific host, very responsive and personable. I called about wifi and he called right back to help me get on the right network, adding that he hoped our stay would be pleasant and to let him know if we need anything else. <br/><br/>We highly recommend this condo and look forward to our next stay!"
22940882,233458289,,61560704,Karli,"Broadcast was perfect for my stay in Seattle! The room is on the 6th floor with amazing views of downtown Seattle and so close to restaurants, public transit, etc. It's a brand new building, so it's very modern...Plus super cute and comfortable furniture too! The Broadcast team were amazing hosts and incredibly responsive to any of my needs. Check-in was very easy... I'd absolutely love to stay again!"
15221864,111311276,,61591724,Wendy,"Emily's apartment is absolutely wonderful- cozy, natural light, great kitchen, and a very comfy bed. It's the perfect distance from the main drag on Capitol Hill... calm and quiet, but a nice quick walk to a ton of restaurants, bars, and the light rail. Emily's a lovely, welcoming host, and was super accommodating when I had a change in plans. I had a really great experience staying here, and would love to stay again!"
19963333,192654468,,61686559,Yaima,We enjoyed stayed at Diddi's. Her place was accurately described. Her house is an older home but it was very clean and she had all the amenities we needed. She was wonderful in giving us tips and showing us places to make the best out of our visit. Read Diddi's tip binder. She had wonderful suggestions that were walking distance we walked to the fish ladder which was only about a 5 minutes from her place. The house had a quite backyard with plastic chairs. Her house was our quite sanctuary after being out and about on the loud touristic places. Overall we had a great experience and hope to be back with our kiddos and stay at Diddi's. Thank you for everything!
14902010,150318104,,61691283,Patrick,"Patti is such a great host! From the moment she welcomed me and during my whole stay she went out of her way to make sure I would have everything I needed. Whenever I reached out to her with a request, her response was immediate and she took care of everything. <br/>The apartment is very conveniently located. There are several supermarkets nearby as well as one of the best breakfast places I found in Seattle. Broadway on Capitol Hill with its variety of great restaurants and bars is only a couple of blocks away. With the bus it's a short ride downtown, the bus stop is just around the corner. <br/>The apartment itself is very cozy. I especially enjoied the huge and fully equiped kitchen. If you want to relax after a busy day exploring Seattle, the Smart TV with Netflix and Amazon Video is a good option. <br/>I had a great time at Patti's place. I would come back anytime."
45425215,710341867,,61703157,Steffanie,Stewart’s place was great. The location was perfect and we’ll definitely be back!
3652078,99489386,,61889959,Mike,Libby's boat is amazing! I had the real Seattle boathouse experience and loved every minute. The Marina is clean and private. Do yourself a favor and book your stay with Libby! She's a great person!
35998945,4.1E+17,,6196447,Claire,"Beautiful home in a convenient location! My husband, daughter, and I stayed for a month while our kitchen was being renovated. Angela’s rental was the perfect staycation spot! There are numerous parks, trails, and food spots within walking distance and cyclists will especially love it! Beautiful interior, great appliances, and best of all in the summer heat was the air conditioning. A/C is rare in Seattle so we counted ourselves blessed when temps peaked over 100 degrees for a few days. I wasn’t a huge fan of the master bedroom mattress but I favor quite soft beds. ,y husband was just fine. The neighbors were very friendly and the area is great for outdoor running. Angela deserves extra thanks because she really went the extra mile for us. She even let us know when one of the neighbors tipped her off that we accidentally left our vehicle lights on. Small touch but it saved us a dead battery hassle the next day. Thank you!"
7.52E+17,8.49E+17,,61965548,Greg,"We stayed here for 2 1/2 months and it certainly is a great setup. The location is great as it's less than a mile to the business districts in Ballard, Wallingford and Fremont. Lots of great restaurants and activities nearby and even walkable if you prefer. The apartment had everything we need. The kitchen was well stocked and had everything we need to cook three meals a day. This location also only has street parking but we never had an issue finding a spot as the side street it is off of had very few cars parked there.<br/>The host, Rachel, was awesome. Although it's a basement apartment with the host living in the house above - we did not have any issues with noise. In fact, we did not even see her until the end of our stay. She was responsive to any needs and genuinely wanted our feedback on amenities, kitchen supplies, etc. <br/>I would strongly recommend this apartment. It's a great location and great setup. After living there for 2.5 months, it definitely felt like home."
1125133,4486644,,6201010,Janet,"On the plus side, the apartment is just a couple of blocks from the university. It is in a very quiet building and there was free parking available on site, though I don't believe that it is always available. There were, however, a few drawbacks. There were no towels of any kind, there was almost no furniture, and the overall feel was somewhat dingy. There was also a 20 dollar cleaning deposit which was not mentioned until after we booked the room."
19414289,293128135,,62012193,Jes,"this place was fantastic! Haley was kind, responsive, and accommodating. The place is very comfortable with a nice tv/sound set up for movies, comfortable furnature, and a nice bathroom. There was a grocery store and restaurants nearby, and it was easy to take the bus downtown. We loved our stay!"
552325,6069447,,6201342,Jonathan,"We enjoyed our month long stay here. The apartment was comfortable and well equipped. The patio facing portage bay was an especially nice place for an evening meal. It was a short walk (15 minutes) or bike ride (5 minutes) to the U. Washington. Getting to downtown Seattle by bus was also very easy (typically not more than 30 minutes door to door regardless of the time of day).<br/><br/>We had a few hicups but Tara and Dan were very responsive and really went the extra mile to make our stay as comfortable as possible.<br/>"
4599119,25631695,,6211900,Adam,"Paige was great, very patient with my questions both before and during my stay. The space is just fantastic for my wife and I, for its decor, furnishings and location, when we come to Seattle."
5969069,31066813,,6212486,Nigel,"The accommodation was exactly as described, if not more impressive! The area is a beautiful residential neighbourhood, with lots of trees, flowers, etc. It's also a very quiet area.<br/><br/>Adam is a great host. He is fast w/ his responses and provided helpful guidance. Upon my arrival at the location, Adam met me in person and walked me around the apt. <br/><br/>As mentioned, the accommodation is amazing. Spacious and modern - incl. a large washer and dryer (separate units) that worked very well. The kitchen is also fully equipped with modern equipment and beautiful plates, cutlery, etc. All that you would need was provided for.<br/><br/>There is a large Safeway about 10mins walk away and there are bus stops close by (I mainly used Uber and it was very easy for them to find the location).<br/><br/>The private garden was great to sit out in during the afternoons and enjoy the sun and peace."
17243214,134336769,,62171347,Alfred,"Ted’s place was very spacious! Lovely apartment that was not too far from downtown. Had everything that we needed: utensils, towels, shampoo, conditioner, sleeping space, and the best part was Chromecast. It was great being able to cast music, YouTube, Netflix, etc to the TV - everything was all set up. Ted was quick to respond to our questions and had very detailed instructions for checking in. The entire process was very easy and hassle-free. One thing to note is that the shower water was on the chillier side. The air mattress is very comfortable and has plenty of room (it's a queen size), but it might be a good idea to bring it upstairs - the grate on the main floor makes a slight clicking noise. There is plenty of parking space both in the garage, in the driveway, and street parking outside."
17589837,147082543,,621853,Sesha,"LUXURIOUS! PERFECT LOCATION! AMAZING HOST! Let me explain:<br/>I still can't believe this is a basement apartment. The space is bright, big, comfy, and fully equipped with EVERYTHING. I parked for free in Seattle (for real), walked to grocery store (high end grocery open 24hrs) and restaurants, and had bomb coffee at Seattle Sunshine Coffee (thanks for the recommendation Lori!) that I walked to. <br/> <br/>Communication with Lori was quick and thoughtful. She sent me details on what to expect on arrival and where to eat (bonus!). I had no questions or hesitations on where to go because of Lori's attention to detail. Having a private entrance is so important to me, however, I arrived a little earlier than expected and I got to meet Lori. She is such a sweet and kind host. She was eager to make sure I was comfortable and had everything I needed. We ended up chatting for a while. I learned that Lori designed the space and actually did most of the remodel herself! She takes pride in her property and it shows. <br/>I love the Seattle decor! Everything in this place is luxury. A lot of people who rent their space usually go a little cheaper on some items. The towels are quality, the bed is to die for (I got to adjust it how I wanted it), fire place made it extra cozy, TWO bathrooms, granite counter tops, quality appliances, Nespresso machine (omg, they even provided the pods!), the desk was a nice touch because I always have my laptop with me, and CLEAN SPACE! I honestly didn't want to leave.<br/>I highly recommend staying here! It's truly five stars across the board from host to space. Thank you Lori, I will be back with a longer stay next time!"
5832908,66275076,,62201044,??,"It was a very good!!! It's containing microwave, refrigerator, and perpect clean bathroom. Especially in room, The temperature is too warm! I didn't feel cold. If you choose this room, you can be great satisfied"
6657574,41036150,,622349,Josh,"Elizabeth is wonderful, welcoming and very accommodating. The space and room is perfect, private and comfortable. And, the location is close to tons of fun stuff and minutes to Ballard, but a few minutes away that the location is quite. Highly recommended."
24443627,256414114,,62272613,Aubrie,Very clean and spacious. Excellent kitchen if you plan to stay in to eat.
18331755,182051555,,62310578,Katie,"My roommate and I stayed in Kimberley's place for 30 days while we were out in Seattle for the summer interning. It was a lovely place with plenty of space and in a great location! The kitchen was great for cooking and the living area had a good sized TV and a large, comfortable couch. The bedrooms were also fairly large and had extremely comfortable queen beds. We were just a couple blocks away from all the main bars in Capitol Hill, but we were far enough away that it was still quiet in the area at night. We had a great stay, and I would highly recommend Kimberley's place!"
45508064,702204830,,62337891,Ashley,"Stylish, clean space. Minimalistic and perfect for longer stays. Home away from home ?"
13033238,79083597,,62339170,Aaron,Everything is clean and comfortable.
51635210,4.33E+17,,62342195,Kyle,"This place is perfect. Clean, amazing area and gracious hosts. Couldn’t ask for a better spot!"
36286516,7.03E+17,,623910,Michele,"In one word, Perfection! <br/>This home exceeded our expectations! We didn’t want to leave. <br/>This beautiful home was filled with anything you may need. <br/>The location and views can’t be beat!"
20029802,184420877,,62448143,Christian,"Amazing apartment! Beautiful, spotless and great access to public transit lines."
2391699,13639510,,6245026,Jack,"Sandy was by far the best AirBNB host I have had to date and I suspect will have. Her home is very comfortable, she is very welcoming and I couldn't have had better suggestions of what to see and do in and around Seattle. And on top of all that we went trail walking on my last day and talked non-stop about everything from philosophy to dog food. Thank you Sandy!!"
23699282,273931072,,62468855,Greg,A must stay. The place was beautiful and close in to Downtown. I liked the personal letter too. Great place!
33988269,463626312,,62573934,Roxie,"What a terrific place! Beautifully decorated, comfortable and clean with many homely touches. Super clean with well stocked kitchen and complimentary tea/coffee. Comfortable beds and plenty of fresh linens made this an easy place to call home. Parking right in front of the building was a big plus. I would definitely stay again. Thank you, Alex, for an awesome stay!"
22736809,240726530,,62674852,Julie,"Casa Fremont was such a fun place to stay! Amazing location within walking distance to downtown Fremont shops, restaurants, Sunday Market, and the Fremont Troll. Just a short drive to Queen Anne, downtown, and SPU (less than 5 minutes). Clean place with fun artwork and a beautiful backyard! We would definitely stay here again when visiting Seattle."
33738155,454625369,,62701450,Damarys,"Amazing find and experience.<br/>Carlos was always quick to respond and very friendly. <br/>Location doesn’t get any better. <br/>Gorgeous apartment. Loved all the little details. <br/>Sparkling clean!<br/>Loved the local coffee with French press, and other treats. <br/>Very easy check-in and check-out. <br/>Highly recommend you book with Carlos!"
16218478,122038118,,62708658,Bintou,Tri was super friendly and helpful. Location is perfect. Apartment looks even better in person. Would definitely stay at this Airbnb next time I visit Seattle. Thanks for making our Seattle trip a very memorable one.
5686435,34973050,,6278975,Tisha,"This is a Beautiful Queen Anne Home indeed. My family and parents (2 couples and 1 baby) LOVED this home. It is simultaneously beautiful and comfortable. <br/><br/>The neighborhood is peaceful and sweet, and only a couple blocks from Macrina Bakery, Ken's Market, and other niceties. <br/><br/>Jennifer was the perfect hostess - reliable, prompt, sweet, and generous. She shared her home without reservation, even offering up her children's toys for play. We will try to stay here again on future visits to Seattle."
26441475,354123731,,62799074,Lindsey,"This place is incredible, immaculate if you will. I’ve never felt so welcomed at an AirBnB before. My dog, Murphy, and myself travel all over the US while I work as a travel nurse. AirBnB is our most frequently used housing search tool. We definitely found a gem inTracy & Quinn’s spot. It’s beautifully furnished, tastefully decorated, and all essentials are provided. The gas stove is a fantastic bonus. Tracy is always available to answer questions/help with anything that might come up."
49907715,763849841,,62818772,Sisi,"I had a wonderful stay at Viet's. Everything was so clean and smelled great. I booked last minute, Viet responded to my messages immediately after I asked if I could check in earlier and let me check in early for free. There was even a squatty potty in the bathroom. Such a great place to rest and relax after a long day of traveling!"
1686930,7931781,,6284522,Lisa,"If you have up to 4 people coming to Seattle, this is a great place to stay. Everything in this apartment is so comfortable, especially the beds. There are two soft arm chairs in the living area which I loved. The kitchen is surprisingly big and we found it was really convenient having the laundry for our use. Even with 4 guests we never felt cramped here, it's very spacious except for the bathroom, but it still has everything you need. Despite being a basement apartment there is loads of natural light, and you have so much privacy it's as if you are in a stand alone house. This location is also an added bonus, you can walk into town within 20 minutes and taxi back (it's a steep hill!) <br/>I really recommend this place if you want a modern and very comfortable place to stay in a great part of town."
30815319,360786417,,62976857,David,"As described, a very cozy, clean, and comfortable place to stay in West Seattle. Nicely decorated with a well equipped kitchen. We walked to the Alaska Junction for eating out, shopping, the bus to downtown Seattle, or a shuttle to the West Seattle water taxi. Alki Beach is also close by (about 2 miles) and easy to get to. If there was anything we needed, Renate was very accommodating. We would definitely stay here again. Thank you. Dave & Jan Miller"
35642589,492942077,,63085008,Jasmina,"Alec replied very fast and friendly to my questions. The apartment is cozy with nice little details. We even got fresh flowers! On top of that, it is very inexpensive for what it offers! The bus stop is also close by and you can be in the city center within 30min."
41237942,619205418,,63119540,Arlo,"This place is awesome! Can’t beat the location; especially when it gets to be summertime! It’s a short walk from a lot of great restaurants and a really nice surfing beach, Alki Beach. Janae was very sweet and helpful and the place is really nice and cozy with a private patio, mini fridge and dishwasher."
50029221,765157165,,63143680,Steven,"Seems like a work in progress. This place looked like a construction zone on the outside, complete with the two guys working in the upstairs apartment making noise all day. The inside of the unit was a cheap remodel with floors that had not been cleaned and showers that wouldn't get hot.<br/>On the other hand, the location was close to downtown and Capitol Hill and the property management was quick to respond. If they take the time to fix the issues this will be a nice place to stay."
51901364,5.96E+17,,63246290,Brigitte,This place was in a great location within Ballard. <br/>Issues were cleanliness/missing blinds/holes within the Airbnb and also there were apparently break-in’s so I would be careful with parking your car on the street. <br/>It may look big but it’s super small so just be prepared.
18504533,152327423,,63263577,Rebecca,"An excellent get away for a girls weekend (2-4 people). The interior is very cute, charming, and clean. The host is very nice and accommodating. The location is great for people who would rather walk through parks than go out and party. Being next to Discovery Park is great, and you are a short walk from the Ballard Locks. Definitely would recommend!"
40236812,595280279,,63372767,Gwen,This was a cozy space in a great neighborhood. My friend and I were able to walk to the international district and the market. Trader Joe’s is also in walking distance. Thank you for the stay!
7264708,68012679,,63442044,Andrew,"This was our families first adventure with AirBnb and we were not disappointed. Kristen went above and beyond our expectations and we were thrilled to have picked such a place to stay. Her communication was excellent and appropriate, helpful and informed. She had fresh flowers out for us, even bought Easter eggs and had candy for my children - what a treat! Towels a plenty and a refrigerator with a few necessities to keep us going on our first day into town. One extra plus was a bottle of wine for my wife and I. Truly, Kristen has mastered the art of hospitality and her guests are treated like royalty.<br/><br/>The highlight of our stay was the view. We had 3 clear days and nights and there is a clear shot from the kitchen and bedroom straight to downtown and the space needle. Any couple would truly enjoy a moment of relaxation with the view.<br/><br/>The kitchen was well stocked with utensils, cups, glasses, wine openers, pots, pans, etc. While we didn't use much of this, anybody looking for a night in, will have what they need. The backyard was private, well decorated and once again had the view. <br/><br/>The decor inside was just like the pictures and was perfect for our family. The blue room was slightly crowded if you needed to use the heater, but was appropriate for our two kids and worked just fine.<br/><br/>Anybody looking for a stay in Seattle will not be disappointed with the location, views, hospitality and accessibility of all that Seattle has to offer. A gem for the price.<br/><br/>Thanks Kristen for the opportunity to stay with you."
49180387,756212495,,63517919,Michelle,"Ying's place was absolutely gorgeous! HIGHLY RECOMMEND HONESTLY<br/>My family and I (6 total) had enough personal space, but also a HUGE common space. The place had everything we needed (cleaning products, towels, etc. honestly anything you can think of). The listing is more residential, but it was no issue for us to go into the central city center by bus which was only a block away. <br/>The extra bathrooms definitely was a huge advantage for a big party and everything was EXTREMELY CLEAN! Ying was also super accommodating with checkin/check out times and the process. If I ever do come back to Seattle, I would love to stay here again."
34397966,452729698,,63619244,Carl,"Shane’s place is centrally located, comfortable, and brand new. Shane was kind and responsive. The roof deck is absolutely beautiful! <br/>Besides the roof deck and gym, note that this listing is only for a bedroom and private bathroom, not access to living room or kitchen. <br/>Shane’s place is a great value and very clean."
42613276,640611775,,63805147,Tony,I’ve enjoyed my stay and reccomends Karen’s place as first pick when you’re visiting the area. Close to everything and super clean. Host was very tentative to anything I needed and communication is great. Thank you for having us!
33079261,445178428,,63813525,Jessica,"Beautiful space. Quiet and really nice neighborhood. Loved the access to Netflix and the separation of certain spaces were really nice. The main floor is beautiful and felt like home. Major plus- beds are very comfortable and sheets and pillows are clean!!! Would def come back because it was a convenient location to downtown without being in the city. Great experience, quick responses to needs from host, our family had a wonderful experience- will be back when we’re in the area."
11398085,72770385,,63813712,Peter,Kathy and Dan were great hosts! It was our first time in Seattle and they were kind enough to give us pointers on where to go when and even some of the cool local spots they love. The apartment is great and that bed is what dreams are made of.
50658555,4.26E+17,,63913785,Meghan,"I can’t recommend this adorable house and Bonnie as a host enough! The house was super clean, and had everything we could need. My five year old son was with us and he loved getting to meet the animals, pick blueberries, and play with the Legos. This is a great spot for families with kids and Bonnie was super helpful and enthusiastic about giving us tips on food, local sites, playgrounds, and more. I hope we get to stay here again in the future. The location is also a very convenient jumping off point for any adventure in Seattle, but in a nice quiet neighborhood, which was great for us."
387078,3141962,,6394536,Aaron,The property was fantastic - just as described. Nick was very helpful upon our arrival and referred some great spots nearby for food and drinks. Would definitely stay again.
44685123,652488607,,64122357,Rosita,"The listing is better than described, if you can imagine that. We made use of virtually every amenity, particularly the outdoor patio with fire pit. There were so many spaces to choose to relax in. The kitchen was fully stocked with every piece of equipment imaginable. The bathroom was light and accommodating. I'm struggling to find constructive criticism- perhaps the absolute worst part of our stay was that the towels were too soft??... and the fact that we had to leave."
41218952,610646214,,6429364,Sonya,"The Jewel Box is such a wonderful space. It was perfect for what I needed. Joline added lots of sweet touches and it's filled with cheery colors and great light which make up for the daylight basement vibes. Kitchen well appointed, comfortable bed, and kind host."
34287681,523517712,,64313188,Joe,"Place is nice, clean, and pretty spacious. Alyssa was super responsive and the check-in was painless."
18121270,144423583,,64341987,Dustin,"The place is nice, and comes with everything you need. The kitchen is new and well stocked with all the essentials if you feel like doing some cooking. Everything is connected with fast internet and the TV is setup for Netflix and HBO which was a plus. The bed was very comfortable with plenty of pillows, etc. And having a washer and dryer in the spot was great as they got some use.<br/>The neighborhood is quiet and nice, a little south of downtown (about 5 miles) and some of the other area neighborhoods, but Georgetown itself is a lot of fun. Plenty of restaurants and bars, and every place I tried was top notch. Also, it is a short ride from the airport which is real convenient as you skip a lot of Seattle traffic.<br/>Would stay again."
2710274,11630676,,6439972,Adam,"Sheryl's house is located a short walk from the main drag of Wallingford. I was able to easily walk to my work right near gasworks park in the morning. The place is a work in progress and has a cool feel to it. Although I was quite busy, Sheryl was nice to talk to when I had the chance."
38218485,532977804,,64417116,Jacob,"Anita’s place was far better than expected, the location was so close to everything you want to see in Seattle. The place was so nice and cozy, made you feel at home, highly recommended"
40373705,3.98E+17,,6441752,Jemma,"My stay here was great. I worked from the tiny house, and the Wifi was definitely strong enough to support that. Stefan has put such nice touches on the place, including a beautiful patio setup. The neighborhood is quiet but still pretty close to livelier areas. I will definitely stay here again on future visits to Seattle."
4236723,21188096,,646435,Christopher,We were the first people to visit this very centrally located space near Ballard. They did all they could to get it ready in time for our arrival.
29384355,352802247,,64649694,Whitney,"Beautiful little home in a wonderful location. Great street, quiet, lovely for walking around. <br/>Easy hosts to communicate with. Comfortable beds and everything you need in the kitchen for preparing family meals. <br/>Hope to return one day."
11497199,70036469,,64841012,Kim,"The apartment/home was BEAUTIFUL. It was very comfortable and had small touches that made the trip easy. The home is conveniently located to nice pubs, little corner store, and a couple restaurants. It was also very quiet. We'd highly recommend staying here. <br/>Bus line very close, or take a cab, or just walk!<br/>"
13082625,86423330,,64936323,Kelsey,Andrew did a fantastic job of preparing us for our stay. Not only was the view beautiful but the house is in great condition and very accommodating. We stayed there while on business so we really enjoyed walking to University Village. Great place and perfect location!
17221609,132084741,,65153099,Heather,"<br/>Kathy's cozy loft was a welcome and peaceful place to recharge by the ocean. I had everything I needed, hot cup of coffee, hot shower and a super cozy bed. Wonderful garden patio and beautifully decorated. Even was treated to decadent chocolate's for Valentine's Day. Slept like a dream! <br/>"
1219691,5358239,,6519545,Siobhan,"I had a great first Airbnb experience in April and Mike's lovely cottage. It is a beautiful blend of the old fashioned coupled with modern updates throughout. April left an abundance of food, more than I could eat in a week and then she left me to myself, which was great!<br/><br/>The house is bright, sunny, and quiet; great for a couple or a small family as the neighborhood is vibrant and friendly. Every room was very clean, well furnished, came with loving details in the decor/book choices that made me feel very much at home and very comfortable. Highly recommended!"
1150519,5581507,,6526379,Juha-Pekka,"Since this house has no reviews yet I want to share our experience!<br/><br/>We (our family, kids 5 & 8 years old) just had wonderful two weeks vacation in Sarah's and her husband's house. The house was exactly like in photos in a really nice old Ravenna neighborhood about 15 blocks north from University of Washingon. <br/><br/>Sarah responded very fast to us and was really nice and helpful. She even invited us over to a glass of wine and tour of the house the day before we moved in as we were already in the Seattle area couple of days earlier. It was nice to go through all the practicalities of the house face to face and to meet the nice people who actually live in the house!<br/><br/>The house itself is a great old well renovated house. We especially appreciated the hardwood floors and the great kitchen. Instead of eating out all the time it was nice to just walk to Whole Foods (4 blocks away) and buy groceries and prepare food in the well-equipped kitchen or with char-coil or gas grill. Also the washing machine and dryer were useful for us. The house has three bedrooms + sofa-bed downstairs in the living room but in reality it is best suited for two couples or a family like ours. <br/><br/>I think the only negative thing with the house was that during the rare Seattle summer heat wave (we had max 89 F) the upstairs of the house gets quite warm (especially if you forget to cover the roof windows in one morning) as the house is old and does not have air conditioning. We are used to this with our summer cottage in Finland but for someone who has lived his life in a/c house: Remember to cover roof windows with curtains in the morning, it helps a lot!<br/><br/>Our kids appreciated the fact that the house has a good entertainment center and a good Wi-Fi network where they could get their iPad games working. Also the neighborhood Cowen Park playfield (in Ravenna Park) was their favorite in addition to swimming in Green Lake (10 blocks). <br/><br/>There is plenty of restaurants within walking distance, a good Whole Foods grocery store + regular Safeway nearby. Good upscale shopping mall University Village is 1 mile away and you can walk there via Ravenna park. The house has an easy access from I-5 and in good traffic conditions downtown Seattle is just 10 mins away by car if you are in a hurry. The bus line to downtown stops just one block away from the house and takes about 15 mins. <br/><br/>As a frequent runner, I appreciated the fact that the neighborhood is good and safe for running with good trails nearby (Green Lake park or Burke-Gilman via Ravenna park). And finally, since this was Seattle, the nearest coffee stand, Cowen Park Coffee, is just one block away and has really good coffee!"
7844098,9.56E+17,,6528972,Ruth,"This is one of the best Airbnb I have stayed. Jeff and Stephanie are great hosts who are responsive, pleasant, and very accommodating. We were so impressed with all the thoughtful details they have put in the bedroom and bathroom. The place also includes a well-equipped working space. The room is beautifully and tastefully decorated with with framed pictures, live plants, fresh flowers, etc. The bed is comfortable for two adults to sleep in. The bathroom has everything you might need and more. The mini fridge is filled with drinks including my boyfriend's favorite beer. There was a nice bottle of red wine on the table, as well as chocolate, tea and coffee. It made me feel like I was in a luxury resort. <br/>The location of the place is excellent. It is safe and quiet with easy parking on the street. There is a nice grocery store Metropolitan Market two blocks away. The Discovery Park is a few minutes away with one of the best views in Seattle area. We absolutely love this place!"
1171574,5027514,,6531938,Wei,It was my first airbnb experience and I happen to be the first guest at Phil and Andrea's. The house is lovely and neighborhood friendly. Phil is very helpful and warm-hearted and keen to offer every help I needed. I only met Andrea once but he is also very friendly. It was a wonderful experience.
36201648,596421879,,65414150,Andrew,Awesome boutique hotel. Clean and quirky but nice place to stay. Included continental breakfast and comfortable bed and room
36316902,483655711,,654265,Ippei,"Awesome spacious place to stay! It is very convenient location- we walked to the supermarket, restaurants, park. It is incredibly spacious with lots of natural light filling the rooms. Nice change to have a kitchen as well. Would stay here again!"
13825056,85114319,,65515184,Connie,"Stacia was very welcoming! The space is quiet, peaceful and very comfortable. I very much appreciated the added touch of having tea and a very comfy bathrobe available. The location is easily accessible. I slept like a rock - it was lovely and I will contact her again when I return!"
23700108,295052603,,6559860,Dillon,Best service
39748737,586391682,,65651582,Jenni,"This space was very cute, clean and cozy. We loved the tiny-home vibe of Jim and Anjelika’s artists villa, its private garden entrance, and excellent location. Jim was very hospitable, easy to reach and gave us a thorough introduction to the space. We stayed here on NYE, AKA a very cold and rainy couple of days in Seattle, so we loved having a fireplace plus heated floors in the bathroom. The space is very bright, but with the option to dim all the lights. In the mornings it was actually insanely bright due to the ginormous skylights! The fancy shower was a water works adventure. The only thing that was missing was some washcloths and maybe a TV, though I did admittedly enjoy being unplugged. The back porch was beautiful for seeing the sun in the am. Wifi was a little wonky but I got it to work on our second day thankfully, since I had a little remote work to do. Overall a lovely experience. Would definitely come back."
4165554,36810391,,6570306,Saumil,"I only interacted with Melissa on the phone. The apartment is safe, but it needs upkeep. Carpets are stained, there's a smell hanging around. Basically it needs tidying up. Kitchen doesn't have a microwave. The weather was quite hot the weekend I stayed here, so I ended up buying a fan and leaving it behind for the guests. Melissa was nice enough to waive off my $30 parking fees for the cost of the fan. The internet access was SLOW. Unusably slow. Melissa gave me another WiFi ID to join to, but even that was congested. I ended up using my mobile data pack instead."
25170755,291420817,,65794375,Abigail,"Book while you can this is a real GEM! Located on a beautiful tree lined street , surrounded by stunning homes. I felt like a true local living in a tucked away (luxurious) studio apartment. I travel often for work and enjoy staying in well designed spaces. This is one of the nicest Airbnbs I have had the pleasure to visit. A true bang for your buck! The hosts are amazing and really go the extra mile to make your stay comfortable (while giving you plenty of privacy). I could easily live in this space. Location is to die for...<br/>Wishing you both all the success with your Airbnb hosting experience . Cheers and thank you for the wonderful stay."
49262712,759353859,,65824510,Stephanie,"I had a wonderful stay! The owner responds quickly, is super informative and the check in process is very simple. The room is basic but cozy. The bed is comfortable and clean. I will say that at time I found myself a bit cold but the comforter was very warm. The location is excellent the bus is a few mins away and you can get around to most attractions without a problem. Gas Works Park is in close proximity you can take a stroll or ride a bike like I did. I would suggest if staying here to go with room A it’s more private and secluded from the other rooms. My only issue with my stay was that the comunal kitchen and bath were not as clean as I would have liked and messy. You can definitely tell it’s shared so if u can’t get passed it, I would recommend. This would serve best for people staying/traveling alone, I didn’t mind it as I was barely there. None the less the room it’s self was clean. I glad I chose this place as my Seattle stay."
51172803,6.02E+17,,658607,Andrew,This is a great place to stay. Great location and well appointed apartment. Host is very accommodating and provides excellent service if any issues come up. Ideal for short-medium term stays.
45651180,710290236,,65897875,Stephanie,"I absolutely loved staying in this gem in the city! The thoughtful details throughout the rental were amazing..so artful and beautiful. You would never think this was a basement as it’s full of light and it’s cozy at the same time. It's also located near two of my favorite neighborhoods in Seattle...Ballard and Fremont...both with great shopping, restaurants and markets.<br/>Shelli was super helpful, kind and communicative which I really appreciate. I definitely plan on staying here on my next getaway."
20970073,197990804,,65984787,Kara,"This was the best airbnb I have ever stayed in and definitely one of the best places I have ever stayed in. Vay-chee was very accommodating and kind making herself available to our needs. The studio had everything we needed and more! With a petite kitchen complete with tea selection and snacks, a cozy bed, books, and board games. After exploring the beautiful city of Seattle we came back to magical garden lights leading us back to our room. I will definitely stay here again! Highly suggested!"
30113499,352040189,,6600640,Ajit,"I stayed at Mindy and Jay's place over the Thanksgiving week. I thoroughly enjoyed staying in the AirBnB - it was quite comfortable place with all the amenities I wanted. Also it was quite private, so I could go in and out easily. The neighborhood is pretty amazing with lot of restaurants and also the best bakery in Seattle - Macrina just few blocks away. I will highly recommend this place to anyone coming over to Seattle for business or pleasure."
50197031,770641057,,66140323,Nicholas,Solid stay. “Haunted tiki bar” - Quote from my partner. Would stay again and highly recommend.
12233882,74552218,,66163521,Qi,????????????????????????????????????????????????????????The room was clean and organized including all daily use essentials. Easy access to transportations and the price is fair enough. I had a great time living here. I will definitely live here again when I visit Seattle next time.
33878810,461031257,,66215247,Arayom,Hadi is an awesome person and host. We really enjoyed every bit of our stay. The house is great and clean as well.
6813623,35971962,,6660762,Elizabeth,"It was a fabulous experience being the first tenant of this wonderful house in Northeast. On a quiet street with a beautiful, private front and back year, the house felt peaceful and relaxing. There is plenty of room for 5 in three bedrooms and two full baths. The kitchen has high end appliances and a granite countertop, with all of the amenities if you like to cook. Anna was very responsive , and the wine, chocolate and bread were all wonderful welcome gifts for our stay. I would definitely rent this house again on a future trip to Seattle."
1716901,34158406,,6669757,Thomas,"Candace's place was clean, convenient, extremely well located and very easy to check in/out. Overall, a great stay in a great neighborhood. Thank you!"
25736941,278338017,,66752175,Caroline,"Great place! Very close to downtown, maybe ten minute drive. In the area all walkable: bakery, delicious restaurants, nice salon, boutiques, two parks with great walking trials. Win win! Another area of Seattle that one should explore!"
22195572,221514189,,66781738,Hugh,"We had a fantastic stay in this beautiful home. The house is so very clean, comfortable a equipped with everything we needed. It was the perfect place for us to spend the holiday. Seward Park is gorgeous. You must walk around that park. We were also pleasantly surprised nearby Columbia City had so many great restaurants and bars. I would recommend David’s place to any traveler. David was also very easy to communicate with and Check in was very easy!"
12249990,70309877,,66820219,Maria,This place is fantastic. It's walking distance to downtown Fremont and the front porch is a lovely spot for your morning cup of coffee.
34575757,508377193,,66831258,Jobair,Great place to stay!
35002263,519508739,,66833135,Marius,"Perfect and cheap place to stay. Just 20 minutes from Seattle downtown with public transport. Bus stop is just 2 min walk from house. Karen submitted all the information needed very clearly and made everything very easy. There is everything you need for short stay, couldn’t get better than this! Thank you!"
48041670,732978957,,66836945,Nick,Amazing place and an awesome host goes above and beyond
19619980,176826440,,66931675,Thomas,"Nice house , great sun roof, polite and helpful hosts."

13712209,83142781,,6714551,Derek,"Jacki was very respondent to all my need, the place was nice and clean, and was walking distance to many bars and fabulous restaurants. They made sure that I had everything that I needed for my business trip. The house was quiet at all times nestled in a beautiful Seattle neighborhood."
45424236,5.31E+17,,67150016,Michael,Amazing townhouse in a great location with good amenities. Check in was easy and Natalia was quick to answer and help out. Would stay here again.
6937492,38787774,,6717012,Suzanne,"The house is very sweet and it is in a beautiful location overlooking the sea with mountains in the background. It is very quiet but also easy to get downtown. Greg and his wife, Barb, were very friendly and interesting people. Great hosts!"
48447536,741292583,,67385826,Rachel,"Everything was as expected and the host, Craig, was very kind and accommodated our early check in request."
6.21E+17,7.11E+17,,67500109,Karen,Wonderful apartment style stay with beautiful views of Seattle! Fantastic amenities (the gym and pools) and in the heart of South Lake Union! Would definitely stay here again in the future and recommend it to others.
12359179,89978192,,67606123,Chelsea,"Communication was great; the host was very helpful and responsive to any questions we had, even while away. The home and it's amenities are amazing. The location is great if you're looking for a safe, quiet neighborhood with shops, restaurant, beaches, and a view just about a mile away. Just an absolutely awesome experience."
17483515,166177289,,67637017,Julia,This is a beautifully finished suite with a lovely garden access. Was glad to see the Keurig with the mini creamers! My 16 year old was comfortable on the pull out. Patrick and Martha were friendly and helpful- directed us to delish local ice cream.
49573435,756725477,,67649330,Tim,"This place is truly amazing! It's brand-spanking new (we stayed in May 2021), clean as a place can be, well-stocked, perfectly located, and Jared is a responsive, communicative host. But wait, there's more! The rooftop has wonderful views in all directions, a hot tub, Solo stove (fire pit), BBQ, string lights, and a great set of outdoor couches for lounging in the evening (or breakfast in the morning). If you're looking for a stylish, modern, clean home base in Seattle, look no further!"
44153528,753745778,,67656335,Shelley,Khynna was wonderful and offered to help in any way she could to make our stay better! She even left us a unexpected welcome gift. As for her home it was beautiful and sunlit with a gourmet kitchen that spilled over into the family room which extended into a spacious outdoor patio! <br/>A perfect retreat.
23702661,276776486,,67660326,Darton,Beatuiful place. Awesome hosts. Highly recommended!!!
19350610,164829422,,677245,Lucas,Great value. Melissa takes care of everything.
26065165,298787438,,67795469,Tim,"Sam’s place was perfect! The pictures don’t do the place justice as it is much bigger than it seems, he has decorated the place incredibly well, three big beds, an awesome master bathroom, and the yard gets great sun to just relax. <br/>Location wise it was a quick trip to all the spots in Ballard, is only a couple blocks from water views, and is nice and quiet for when you get back to relax. <br/>Sam was a super helpful host who was flexible with our schedule, made getting in simple, and had the place spotless for our arrival. He was available for anything we needed during our stay as well. <br/>We would happily return for our next trip to Seattle!"
5523181,9.38E+17,,67804801,Adrienne,"Jeremy's space was gorgeous and super well located. He's super responsive as a host and was very accommodating to our request to check out a little later. Overall, a lovely space and a great place to stay. Highly recommend!"
24245145,255512408,,67836920,Kyle,Great spot that provided us with a location that was centralized for everything that we wanted to do in our short 1.5 day get away to Seattle. Anna was an exceptional host and wouldn’t hesitate to stay again if/when I am back in town again
26143461,285103525,,67936757,Daniel,"Nice space, good location, and simple check in!"
2446384,88812435,,67946242,Matt,"Susan and Joel were kind and accommodating hosts, making our three night stay at their house a pleasurable experience. The bed was comfortable, and the basement was welcomingly cool (there's a space heater down there if you like it warmer). The room and house were well-decorated, and there was a small but useful private kitchen area with a sink, a fridge and an electric kettle that we used to make coffee in the mornings, provided by our hosts. Overall a really nice place to base a weekend trip to Seattle."
20641402,191008852,,68110505,Michael,Max was awesome and incredibly helpful in making our stay a good one. Max went an extra step in making sure we felt comfortable in our home away from home while we were in Seattle.
49113608,770204547,,68142566,Shelby,"This house is BEAUTIFUL, comfortable and in a great location. We would absolutely stay again"
15700294,351141311,,68316074,Yupeng,"Lisa and Randy are very responsible hosts. They replied very quickly to our request and provided us much help during our stay of the summer and fall. They even installed a portable air conditioner and replaced the blinders for us. Additionally, the room is well furnished and quiet (since its windows are not facing to the street). We like most about the comfortable bed and large TV. The parking and package delivery places are secured and safe. I would definitely recommend it to the individual or couple who work at downtown or south lake union area, since it is very walkable to everything needed (restaurants, stores, tourist spots, etc) at Seattle."
24561301,265940966,,68397038,Ryann,"This place is a gem, all of the furniture brand new, cozy and stylish. The king bed was super comfortable and the shower had great water pressure. The views are absolutely breathtaking. Facing west and being able to see both Puget Sound and Mt Rainier, the sunsets were a treat to watch on the balcony. The location and neighborhood were outstanding, full of some of the best little parks to take in the views of the city. Annie was an awesome host, and gave us great tips and recommendations for our vacation. We loved our stay, and would come back again!"
13141142,80286808,,68445688,Allan,"the place is great, brand new renovated, clean, nice bathroom, full of kitchen equipment, comfortable and the size if right enough for 1-2person to stay. I was try to extend one night even I didn't make it but Liz've been very helpfull, I'd like to stay at this place next time."
14108275,92060811,,686618,Cami,"Betty was a fantastic host. Excellent communication, the place was cozy, clean and well cared for, felt like we were staying with a friend. Would definitely stay here again!"
8101791,99955992,,68697171,Esther,Neighborhood feel with easy access to shopping and dining. I walked to University Village easily. Unit has private bathroom and access. It is quaint and very vintage.
4170863,20478146,,6876797,Jeff,"The place was beautiful, very well put together. The bathroom (the shower mostly was awesome, after being stuck on a train for two days. Faith was very accommodating, she allowed us to park our bicycles in the garage. She was there to welcome us, and answer any questions. She responded in a very swift manner with any inquiry we had."
41862187,616084121,,68839803,Steven,A nice house with a beautiful view.
2620429,12982721,,6884354,Jeremy,"Do yourself a favor and stay at this place. Walking distance to Pike Street Market, full kitchen AND washer/dryer, spacious, clean, and awesome rock and roll posters on the walls. Siena is also an amazing host, she is very responsive to any questions...and when I arrived there was a welcome basket with fruit, bottled water, and beer. I've stayed in a lot of hotels and this is by far the best travel lodging experience I've ever had.<br/>1 heads up -- if you plan on having a car just know that the only available free parking is on the streets, and you better be good at parallel parking. I had to drive around a bunch of times a couple nights. Lots of paid parking available too. <br/>As for me this will be my first choice for any future stays in Seattle."
11304405,64730708,,6887431,Madison,"Wow! Hands down the best Airbnb experience I've ever had. To start, Karen was extremely flexible with my arrival and departure times. She prepared their little guest cottage with daffodils, a local Theo chocolate bar, sparkling water and even a handwritten note. Talk about a warm welcome! The space of course is adorable. Comfortable bed, modern shower and perhaps the cutest kitchen on this earth. My only small tip would be to pack warm pjs as it got rather chilly in the evening. Close-ish to Ballard, though I would call it Crown Hill. You'll need to Uber or prepare to walk a fair clip (mile or so) to get down to the central hood. All in all, I highly recommend this little getaway especially if peace and quiet is your mantra."
53116778,5.38E+17,,68939870,Rinna,Cozy home close proximity to the freeway and a few minutes away from downtown. Located in a quiet neighborhood. Clean and spacious with open floor plan. John is a wonderful host and respond quickly. Would stay there again.
20920840,199739898,,68951335,Peter,Great place and spacious
12929985,73976406,,6903266,Stacey,"We loved loved loved our stay here. Every detail was perfect. We arrived to wine grapes and cheese, lush towels and clean comfy bed. Luxurious and clean place to be. Tim and Susan are fun and kind and generous. I highly recommend staying here. The two dachshunds are hilarious and entertaining. Just all around fun and easy and wonderful. <br/>Thanks Susan and Tim!"
1407502,14125924,,6903424,Janna,"My stay at Nicole's surpassed all my expectations. Her home is beautiful, super comfortable, and conveniently located in a very safe, fun neighborhood. The guest space comes with an open outdoor patio with a garden. She provides very nice bedding and a Keurig coffeemaker in the guest room with organic coffee (or alternatives if you prefer tea, decaf or hot chocolate). Nicole herself is great: funny, kind, down to earth, and extremely helpful. Nicole was good at commuting before and during the trip. She made me feel welcome and helped me to find great places to go around Seattle. She's a chef and is well connected to the ""foodie"" scene, so has a lot to say if you're interested in finding great spots to eat -- everything from food trucks to french bakeries. This was the perfect traveling experience for me. I highly recommend Nicole's place to anyone!"
19591463,172367566,,69184136,Lindsay,"This place was awesome! Close to downtown Seattle but far away enough so you can relax and enjoy a private little retreat with the 2 cutest little goats! Luke has done an amazing job with this place making it feel cozy and like a home. Having a washer and dryer was so nice to have especially with a 3 year old. We were sad to leave, especially the bed that felt like heaven! Thanks for being such a great host and being available when we needed you!"
20851050,194952007,,6920318,Emily,"I had a lovely stay at the Messinger’s. The apartment is quiet, with its own private entrance and a nice view out toward the sound. Well-equipped with flat-screen TV and cable (though I didn’t watch much), fast wifi, compact washer/dryer and a full kitchenette including a full-size stove and fridge, plus microwave, even a drop coffee maker. The location is great - walking distance to some good restaurants and cafes, not to mention an awesome park, close to bus lines. The mattress was quite comfortable and I slept great - the apartment is very quiet. Everything is clean and it feels recently updated. Great value, good communication - I’d stay again in a heartbeat!"
1175308,6278520,,6921570,Rachael,"Myself, my husband and our 3 year old son stayed in this house for 2 and a half weeks. We had a very enjoyable time there! We helped mind the owners chickens who were very cute and we enjoyed being able to collect fresh eggs from them every day. The house is located in a very friendly and nice part of Ballard and it is withing walking distance of some lovely parks. A favourite of ours was Salmon Bay park as there is a big sandpit there which our son loved. The house is also within walking distance of Market Street where there are some lovely shops and restaurants. Ballard Market is definitely a must on the weekend too! All in all we had a lovely stay :-) and the Davidson's were very helpful and welcoming!<br/>"
27208473,297381258,,69239964,Blaine,Space was awesome. We would certainly stay again next time we’re in the city!
20137424,245095168,,69297010,Elisa,"We stayed at Jim's place for 4 nights in March and definitely could have stayed longer. We really enjoyed how close it was to everything and that there was driveway parking. There were bars, restaurants, and even Freemont Brewery all within walking distance."
19553691,170506232,,6931145,Karen,"This home is delightful, clean and tidy. It's a newly remodeled shotgun apartment in a quiet duplex. Close to neighborhood restaurants and a grocery store. Sights in the city are a short commute away. One spacious bedroom and bath. Kitchen has been thoughtfully appointed. Open floor plan living room and dining room/ kitchen makes for comfortable socializing and relaxing space. The bedroom is quiet! No airplanes or city noises. We enjoyed a picnic at the lake which was just a quick jaunt down the hill. This place has a nice backyard area. Some stairs to walk up to the entry way. I would stay here again with no hesitation. Travis was a great communicator and made every effort to ensure our comfort."
12812601,75790669,,69410315,Janie,"Recently visited the Ravenna Retreat for over a week. We found it comfortable, clean and spacious, in a lovely quiet corner of town. Karen was a gracious and helpful hostess. Definitely recommend it to all!"
7886645,101873213,,6946968,Shelby,"This should be received as the most glowing recommendation possible; By far the best Airbnb, if not any host encounter I've ever had the pleasure of experiencing. Kelsey went above and beyond to ensure comfort and quality, from taking care of breakfast accommodations to keeping open communication throughout the entirety of my trip. <br/><br/>The space itself, however attached to the main house, felt like it's own apartment and resembled the pictures perfectly. There was no trouble entering through the kitchen, with it's own enclosed staircase it was very private and Kelsey and her husband were nice about offering space or engaging in friendly conversation. <br/><br/>The location itself was great: walkable, close to restaurants, grocery and the U District. While close to the highway, it wasn't at all too noisy at night, offering it's own peaceful abode.<br/><br/>I could go on and on! It was truly a home away from home."
13334770,78178561,,6949593,Anne-Lauren,"Excellent rental. We have rented this unit before, and both times had amazing experiences. Perfect hostess."
1260259,5332755,,6961066,Annalisa,"This was a very positive experience: I warmly recommend this little paradise if you want to visit Seattle and at the same time stay away from tourist area. The house was spotless, cozy and the little garden a gem!<br/>Jess left me a lovely note and everything went according to expectation! Thank so much Jess you will hear from me again for sure!!!"
13606919,84546053,,69612647,Erica,The place was perfect for our trip to Seattle. It was welcoming and William has thought of every detail. It's easy to check in and out. I hope we stay here again when we visit Seattle.
37495691,513648803,,69721430,Andrew,Helen's place is in a great location and well equipped for a short trip. She treated me kindly and made sure I had everything I needed for a pleasant stay.
15816866,127880131,,6985440,Debbie,"Molly's place was absolutely stunning! She had all the necessities (and more) to make our stay comfortable and cozy. We loved the fireplace, the comfortable couches and the natural light everywhere in the house.<br/>We slept like babies in the cozy beds that had soft sheets and comforters.<br/>The kitchen was fully equipped with everything needed to cook and had the feeling of being in a tree house setting.<br/>Her place is very walkable to the lake and light rail! We didn't need a car for what we had planned. <br/>We would highly recommend and can't wait to come back!"
4440686,363931683,,699024,Kristiina,"LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION!<br/>We loved the fact that we could park our car and leave the keys on the counter for the entire week and not rack up parking bills! If you're looking for an adventure and love to walk, then there's countless things to do and places to eat right outside this condo. We walked to Anthony's, the ferris wheel, the Aquarium, the docks to watch seals, Pike Place Market, coffee shops, the Crab Pot, stores, etc and more! <br/>This location on Alaskan Way was unusually quiet with updated huge picture windows that had views of the water and a very safe gated entry for vehicles (parking garage) and strolling onto the street.<br/>The condo is very clean and very well stocked with everything you would need for a short or long stay (we stayed for 6 days). Lots of modern touches. Beds were VERY comfortable with pillows galore. Huge picture windows with great views, fireplace for Santa to come down (we stayed through Christmas), unlimited shows, movies to watch if you want to stay in your pajamas all day. Balcony perfect for two!<br/>We had a great experience in our stay here and would definitely recommend this place to others as a perfect location to have adventures every single day. Oh, and don't forget your bathing suits... there's a hot tub too!"
6794702,47407165,,699829,Sylvia,"Nick was new to hosting, he was attentive and appreciated our feedback, a lot of which he immediately implemented. Nice space which felt a bit like a cabin. Though it is located on a main street, it is facing the back wirh a garden abd oark behind it and is quiet. Short walk to RapidRide bus stop (C line), stores and the Junction with plenty of great stores, restaurants and coffee shops."
46361697,714130355,,6998320,Jason,Tyson and Meg are great hosts. They were very easy to book through and communicate with.<br/>The space is one entire floor of their house. It is very cozy and thoughtfully decorated. They have usb charging in the bedroom for your phone and a heavy comforter on the bed.<br/>Everything was very clean. The sheets and towels are white so you can see they are clean and that are also soft to the touch. <br/>The neighborhood is quiet with a great Pacific Northwest vibe.
23104353,240703481,,70051124,Joan,"We loved this townhouse! It’s so comfortable, clean, and attractive. Great kitchen with everything you need. Super comfy beds and bed linens. Quiet. Accessible to many shops and cafes. Absolutely loved everything about this place!"
20774329,195277287,,70097475,Dennis,"Beautiful, spacious property. Can accommodate large groups and the view from the deck and master bedroom is amazing. Highly recommended"
635878,5848588,,7013326,Javier,"The apartment is located at University district which is very handy. There its possible to find almost everything and its very close to UW (which is gorgeous). <br/>The apartment was clean and good looking. It was equipped with a nice kitchen and toilet (not sharing).<br/>In general good experience. <br/>Thanks Melissa for your hospitality.<br/>"
53272402,5.06E+17,,70172200,Victoria,"Great, well designed room at a perfect location for walking to restaurants, bars, or essential shopping. Also close to plenty of public transportation to explore the rest of Seattle. I appreciated the small touches like dimmable lights and travel essentials that made my stay cozy."
50159729,4.2E+17,,70196789,Bobby,Enjoyed myself: A
50038410,9.62E+17,,7022845,Carlos,Great location in Capitol Hill. Management company tried to charge and additional cleaning fee. It seems that $395 wasn’t enough to clean a 500 sqft apartment.
16338772,124390950,,70256988,Annmarie,"Communication prior to our arrival was great; follow up to any questions both prompt, and thorough. The location was perfect, and walking to distance to shops, dining, and even LIVE music. <br/><br/>The apartment had every thing you could hope for, and very comfortable. We loved the fun decor, and eye to detail. There were great art pieces throughout, and the natural light made for a great space to relax.<br/><br/>They've set it up as well or better than any hotel, toiletries included, maps, and a very detailed reference manual of local attractions, dining, menus, and more. We were staying over the New Year's weekend, and were surprised with a complimentary bottle of champagne & chocolates!<br/><br/>I would consider this a home as opposed to an apartment. We found it very spacious, and even a small backyard perfect for the spring/summer months. We will be back for sure, and intend to make our next visit longer. Daniel, and his family were amazing hosts, and we thank them for making this a perfect experience! You have all the privacy that you need, and yet they are just a few steps away if you need anything - truly an ideal set up."
6.26E+17,6.92E+17,,70287874,Jakub,"Ashutosh has been a fantastic host! I was actually the first person to stay at his AirBnB, so I was a little wary without seeing any previous reviews. But he was kind enough to meet me before booking to assuage my worries. Throughout my stay, he was very communicative and responsive as well (and took to heart some of my requests, like asking for an extra pot). <br/>The place itself is very clean and comfortable, with all the typical amenities you might need for a stay (plus a washer and dryer if you're in a pinch). Because it's a basement unit, it also stayed nice and cool during the Seattle Heatwave! <br/>The area around isn't big, but there are a few bars and restaurants to check out, as well as a convenience store (that also serves beer and has front sitting - interesting spot to check out). You can also walk to Ballard in 15-20mins which has a ton of stuff to do, and there's a rapid bus line that will get you to Fremont and Downtown very quickly. Plus, not far off from a big lake (Greenlake) if you don't mind a longer walk or a quick Lyft/Uber ride. <br/>Overall, it was a great stay and I definitely felt safe and comfortable!"
37935442,520618203,,7031303,Emmy,"We had such a lovely and comfortable stay at Mariana and Amy’s guest suite. They were warm and welcoming, extremely accommodating and with great advice for the area. The suite itself is large, comfortable and clean with a well set up kitchen, large comfy couch and some speakers to listen to music and enjoy some down time. There is a bus just outside that will take you downtown or Capitol Hill with many lively bars and restaurants a 20 min walk away. I would highly recommend you come and stay here. Thanks again for having us!"
44164238,662423374,,7034184,John,"Solid place, with all the stuff you need to cook as well."
21014515,197977576,,7042344,Tim,"It was so easy to stay out all day with so many of seattle's attractions near by, but then you couldn't enjoy a glass of wine watching the sun setting over the puget sound from this styly pad. Incredible house and host. Thank you!"
40909725,589768274,,70446560,Oskar,Great place !
1000883,5424986,,7057633,Alissa,Nicole was an excellent host and the cottage was clean and well kept. I loved waking up to the bright colors on the walls and of the original pieces of art around the room. This cottage was in a great location. I got up and ran down to the shoreline to an amazing view of the Seattle skyline. It was also just a short water taxi ride to the city. We had a great stay.
19161696,161889799,,70666374,Arjun,"If you're traveling with 4 or so people, this house is ideal. In a quiet neighborhood, local activities are relatively close, hosts are very caring and helpful, and of course free eggs from the chickens in the back! I don't see any place being better for a weekend in Seattle."
15598375,113970235,,7069309,Ed,"I did not get to meet Phoenix is person but he was super easy to communicate with and made sure I had everything I needed. The place is exactly as described and very clean! He even set some city guides out and even had OJ and bagels in the fridge. As for the location, it was PERFECT for me. It is right in the heart of capitol hill, nearby lots of restaurants and other attractions. The underground parking was also super convenient especially for the area where parking can be a nightmare. I would definitely recommend this place and would be ecstatic to stay at Phoenix's place again when I'm back in the area!"
12908346,73793305,,70725718,Christina,"This was my first time visiting Seattle,and a spontaneous trip for my daughter and I.We were new to using Airbnb,and after this experience,i dont think i could ever stay at a hotel again!We reached out to Kumail the day we were flying out and he got back to us right away.It was important to me traveling to a new city that my daughter and i had a nice,clean safe place to call home for a couple days.This was perfect!Kumail was great,and so accommodating when it came to our schedule. We flew in a late,and he was able to meet us with the key, due to our arrival time.What a great host and place."
14011625,87665253,,70845404,Joella,The directions were easily followed and everything in this cute little space were exactly as described. We'll definitely be staying here on our next trip through Seattle!
12056343,78502817,,71001288,Sam,"Mark made us feel immediately welcome to his beautiful home. When we arrived he had left us some local coffee and a bottle of wine. The home itself is very cozy, lots of natural light, and a great kitchen to cook in. The neighborhood is quiet and in a great location. Mark was quick to respond to my text messages and address anything we needed. I highly recommend this home ands would certainly go back. Thanks Mark!"
30290674,419340133,,71133958,Cathleen,"Tom and Ellen were the perfect hosts! I have stayed in a fair share of places through AirBnB and this was my favorite. The location is walking distance to bus stops to take you to anywhere in the city you may want to go. The space is perfect for relaxing and honestly feels very spacious. Small touches such as breakfast foods, coffee and extra soft, fluffy towels offer a warm welcome. Great communication as well, if you have any questions. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and highly recommend!"
7.79E+17,8.46E+17,,71165353,Laura,Great place. Clean
47816231,4.28E+17,,71185688,Robert,"We stayed at Holly's place for two weeks while visiting our son and daughter-in-law who live nearby. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The apartment was spacious, clean, and well equipped. Holly and Frank were great hosts making sure that our stay was enjoyable. We had everything we needed. The information on the website was accurate. <br/>The panoramic views of Puget Sound were fabulous. We could watch the marine traffic including the Washington State ferries passing by on a regular basis. The sunsets were amazing. Alki beach is a very easy walk and provides great restaurant venues. The traffic in this part of the city is very easy to handle we had no trouble getting around.<br/>I would say that our stay in West Seattle at Holly's place was one of the best Airbnb experiences ever. We hope to return again."
11282097,74232273,,71200013,Rehab,"My flight delayed and I arrived at 11:40 pm to her home and I appreciate that she was still awake waiting for me until I arrived. <br/>She is very nice and welcoming. The room is very clean , private and spacious. Also , the bathroom is very clean and modern. <br/>It was easy to contact her for information and she always responded very quickly. <br/>I would definitely recommend this place! <br/>Really nice experience. <br/>"
54396923,6.25E+17,,71229781,Richard,"This house is as inviting as it is spectacular. Immediately one is comforted with bright rooms illuminated with dazzling chandeliers. A kitchen fit for any chef; preparing, entertaining, or simply making breakfast for friends will be a breeze. Communal spaces are equally paired with plenty of privacy with key padded bedrooms. Luxury doesn’t stop at the bathroom with a high pressure shower and heated floor. This is the perfect home away - regardless if your stay in Seattle is business or pleasure. Linger for a while, you may learn something new about Seattle if you really look around."
14717074,99497062,,71281780,Katherine,"I can't imagine a better location to become your home base while exploring Seattle. Set a little south of the city, it took just 5 minutes to walk to the light rail going downtown or the airport or many other locations. The apartment is spacious and secluded. Furnished beautifully with lots of comfy places to hang out and relax. And that shower! Don't get me started! The windows open up to Karra's beautiful back yard where I enjoyed my coffee every morning. Plus the kitchen is nicer then mine at home and if you weren't traveling to Seattle to eat in all the fabulous restaurants, it would be a pleasure to cook in. Karra and her family were so welcoming and helpful, answering all my questions (and there were a lot of them!) before arrival and during my stay. <br/> Karra knows the food scene in town and has all the insider tips on where to grab a fabulous meal. Plus, the neighborhood, Mount Baker, is very pedestrian friendly with great parks in walking distance including access to Lake Washington. The south end of Seattle is a hidden gem. Less crowded and more culturally diverse then other neighborhoods and with great access. Karra's place is super close to I-90, where you need only drive 45 minutes to access some of the most magnificent hiking the pacific northwest has to offer. The family, again, was an invaluable resource in planning a day hike. I just can't say enough good things about this place. Stay here for a wonderful, relaxing, genuine Seattle experience! You will love it!"
42671642,619485952,,7135496,Andrea,This a great house in a perfect location in Seattle. It's a very comfortable space. The house was nicely put together and clean when we arrived. Walkable to many restuarants and coffee shops. Also has parking huge plus!
54128002,6.09E+17,,7144192,Debbie,"Danni's place is new, and clean just as described on the website. Everything was new and clean. We enjoyed the view from the rooftop and the furniture was nice. She was very responsive and accommodated our travel plans. Her house is in a great location, within walking distance of a market and many good restaurants. It was a great value and we would stay there again."
8.83E+17,9.07E+17,,7205125,Feyisola,"Located in a quiet and accessible neighbourhood. Stacey was the perfect host - available, responsive and accommodating.<br/>Accommodation was pristine, cosy yet modern. Large TV :)<br/>Hope to visit again. Thank you Stacey, for everything."
7.22E+17,7.46E+17,,7240759,Kate,"This house was perfect for a family with a toddler- the neighborhood is quiet and very walkable, the house was really well outfitted for cooking, and had more amenities than listed. The house had a high chair, changing table and Sonos speakers, and the gas fireplace was really cozy and nice in the evenings. We had a great stay, the bedrooms were really comfortable, the kitchen had everything we needed and it felt more like a home than a rental. We'd love to stay again!"
12272813,79992897,,7241188,Yosuke,"Easy check in, check out. Unit is brand new and clean. High end appliances and fixtures. Quiet and peaceful. Accommodating hosts. Good communication. Wish I had more time in the area. Would recommend without hesitation!"
45623387,704709224,,72426913,Sarah,Great location and very comfortable bed. I was glad to have so many windows for good daylight and the Wifi worked very well for me as a remote worker. The Kitchen was well-supplied with everything. The space heater was very helpful now that it's getting colder. Family member Noreen living onsite is very friendly and kind - so glad I got to chat with her.
1484595,6718826,,7242811,Peter,"Fantastic location -- lots of low-cost eating and entertainment options, and the 7X bus line will get you downtown very conveniently and quickly. As a host, Melissa is very responsive via text message should you have any problems or questions. The apartment is a bit on the shabby side (assorted student furniture), with views of an alley-way and parking lot. If what you need is a place just to sleep convenient to downtown or UW you'll be fine. Internet service was very very slow all 10 days of my stay -- don't plan on any kind of skype meetings in the apartment!"
22181271,277184927,,7245172,Angelina,"Della is a great host, very responsive and helpful. The place was spacious, clean, and welcoming. The keyless entry is a smart touch and I loved the outdoor space. Would come back again in a heartbeat!"

49467093,4.3E+17,,7273376,Rahul,"The place is perfectly situated for someone who wants to sample life in seattle/capitol hill. Public transport is close by and a lot of restaurants close by as well. <br/>The place is small, but it is designed really well and the space is utilized really well.<br/>The host is fantastic and responds very quickly ."
13017780,80125255,,72737485,Jennifer,"Loved your adorable, cozy home! Thanks for letting us stay :)"
8165389,77183947,,72793074,Ryanne,"Cara was an excellent host, very accommodating and considerate of our needs. The apartment reflected her attention to detail and thoughtfulness. The apartment was comfortable and clean and had everything we needed for a long weekend. We enjoyed the area, easy to get around, easy to find parking, neighborhood was pretty quite but close to the action and there was plenty to do close by. We’d be happy to stay here again."

40843077,580537072,,7288325,Gillian & James,"Our stay exceeded our expectations in every way. Absolutely beautiful spot with all the amenities necessary and more. Sparkling clean and cozy with modern Scandinavian touches and comfortable beds and laundry for lengthier travels. This was the perfect location for a weekend getaway and to explore a wonderful Seattle neighborhood while being close to downtown. Ballard neighborhood is very hip - we frequented local cafes, breweries and shops (on every corner) and were able to manage all of our last minute holiday shopping. Thank you so much to our wonderful hosts!"
6053606,31133038,,728883,Guillermo,"The house is beautiful, Rachelle did a great job in decorating the house with antiques of the time. It is very well located, just a few blocks from really nice restaurants and Gas Works Park in the other direction. It is still very quiet with easy parking. Rachelle was a gracious host, making sure that I'd feel welcome."
5620306,49532063,,7299194,Manoj,"Staying at this airbnb accommodation has been one of my best experiences so far. The place is as described on the site, perhaps better than that. With tons of natural light and view of Mt. Rainier from the bedroom, it certainly is a premium accommodation. I stayed here for one week and worked from home. And its just been terrific. <br/><br/>Muna is a fabulous host. She made me feel welcomed to the place. She made sure that I was comfortable with everything, and gave me my privacy, whenever I wanted it. She was very courteous, caring and communicative throughout my stay. <br/><br/>Overall, I had a great stay and I will certainly consider staying here again, whenever chance permits me next."

8.87E+17,8.92E+17,,7314650,Ryne,"Great place to stay while visiting Seattle. This home is spacious and comfortable, with nice furniture and decor. The location was great, within walking distance to the light rail station for easy access to downtown. Whole Foods, car rental locations, restaurants, and other stores are located close by as well. The beds were comfortable, showers had good water pressure, and we especially appreciated the AC which kept the place cool during a spell of hot weather. We enjoyed evenings in the backyard space with the grill and fire pit. Andrew was a very responsive host who provided clear instructions for an easy checkin via the keypad entry. Highly recommended."
22494869,231777467,,7323422,Bryan,"This was really great! Not only was it well located, only 10 minutes from downtown Seattle, we really liked the proximity to Tangletown and 45th. It was a nice walking down for coffee and breakfast in the morning.<br/>We really like the clean, stylish full kitchen, and also the separate office where I could get away to do some work in private.<br/>I will definitely keep this in mind for a longer stay next time I am in Seattle. I could easily see staying here for longer stays."
23787402,634077248,,73325887,Portia,Great place if you are traveling with a dog! Wendy is very helpful. The location is perfect. They really made me and my pup feel like home here.

13313994,79603114,,73456694,Ashley,"Listing description exactly as described. Studio was amazing. Location was ideal. Place was quiet, never heard any neighbors. Felt very safe. Unit was clean and modern. I already recommended Airbnb and this listing to friends. This was my first time using Airbnb and I must say I'll probably never go back to using hotels. The price was cheaper then a hotel in the same area but I didn't sacrifice anything. The studio was so adorable and the location was everything. I will defiantly stay here again. Assistance was available when needed."
23042701,233238562,,73462835,Martina,Amazing host/guest communication and downtown location! Cheap to uber and a good walk; close to trader joes ????. Very clean and well organized for guests.

13437692,82055048,,73786862,Lois,"Patti & Ken have a lovely home in a prime location! Home is located in a quaint neighborhood that is in walking distance of good eats and anything else we needed. We felt comfortable in their home and everything was as described, there was no detail left undone. They were gracious hosts and we enjoyed our stay. We would definitely stay here again!"
1351716,5724414,,7379360,Elaine,"If you are planning a trip to Seattle I would highly recommend this private guest house. Communication, accommodation, hospitality, convenience and location were all top notch. It made out first airbnb experience perfect. Thank you Bill and Huong!"
36732856,520586095,,73945531,Maddy,"Thank you for a great stay! Very comfortable bed, great location, super clean, and well-accommodated. Love the extra touches like soap and toothpaste in the bathroom, and on-the-go breakfast! Would definitely stay again."
12918045,78727037,,73978596,Matt,"William's apartment was great! It's well-located, easy to get to downtown, and very walkable to all kinds of good restaurants and coffee shops. The apartment was spotless and very nicely decorated. We would absolutely stay here again in the future."
15109066,103665625,,74137024,Alysse,"We loved our stay at Molly's in Seattle! The apartment was very clean and comfortable, not to mention super cute! It felt like home from the moment we arrived. Keep in mind, although in a lovely, quiet neighborhood, it is not really walking distance to anything. Molly directed us to public transportation and that was easy enough to navigate. We were very glad to not have to drive ourselves anywhere in all the Seattle traffic. We followed several of Molly's recommendations and were always pleased. I would stay here again and definitely recommend it to anyone planning to visit the area!"
27485425,303184223,,74169163,Nicole,Julia was a great host to work with quick and very helpful! The place was very nice! Well stocked and taken care of! We had a great stay! Thank you!
13751731,99685904,,74176607,Andre,Made my experience great! They were very understanding and did there best to accommodate for my group!
19350639,166885234,,74209441,Mylinda,"Great communication with host! She always replied within a minute. The location was within walking distance to the university, restaraunt as and stores! I'd stay here again. It's small with small beds, which was perfect for my mom and I, but may not be ideal for a couple. Perfect for sleeping, but not a great place to hangout with the bed in the livinnroom and no couch. It was exactly what we expected and needed though! Thank you, Melissa!"
47583248,728239856,,74230101,Jon,We had a nice stay and everything was as described.
50365391,6.49E+17,,74285027,Joane,"We enjoyed our stay at Ed's place in Ballard. <br/>The location is perfect. Ballard is a fun place to hang out, everything is within walking distance, the grocery store, restaurants, the park, the water, etc. We love staying in Ballard.<br/> <br/>The Airbnb is spacious! I'm not sure why this is listed as a shared room, because it is basically a two-bedroom apartment, with a full kitchen and 1.5 baths. It just shares an entry, and stairwell with other apartments. But the apartment is completely private, with locks on the main door and each bedroom door.<br/> <br/>The kitchen has everything you need. The coffee maker was top of the line and Ed had coffee beans so we could grind fresh coffee every morning. The tea kettle was also special because it has temperature control, so you can set the tea to just the right temperature. <br/> <br/>The beds and bed linens were super comfortable. Everything was clean. Check-in and check-out were quick and easy, and Ed was super responsive.<br/>Looking forward to coming back here to stay."
45057603,657988638,,74299235,Jennifer,"Lovely space, walking distance to many great places to eat/drink, very charming bar below with great staff!"
13216773,77483372,,74304824,Jim,"My wife and I stayed in this beautiful, luxurious loft for a Seattle getaway and we absolutely loved it. It was like being in a high end hotel room suite but with our own kitchen (though I have to admit, we didn't cook because there are so many great restaurants nearby). The french doors that open up to a view of the water is really lovely. The location can't be beat, located near the Seattle Art Museum, Waterfront and Pike Place Market. There is a wonderful restaurant right downstairs called Heartwood Provisions. Stay here - it will make you fall in love with Seattle like we did."
35381715,472478400,,7433021,Diana,A bit smaller than what I expected but just fine for my stay. There’s no elevator and I was on the 5th floor with huge luggage so be aware! Magic was quick to respond when needed and the location is quiet but close enough of a walk to busy Capitol Hill.
53242934,5.6E+17,,74482753,Mark,Amazing location in a great neighborhood. Close to lots of dining but still in a quiet neighborhood. Rachel did a fantastic job making sure everything was set up for us and really response to things (thermostat battery going out). Good sized fenced in back yard for your pup to do it's business. Only a couple miles to the main bars on Capitol Hill which means cheap Ubers for a night out.
18934440,156218469,,74488353,Leah,Perfect location. Beautiful home. Amazing hospitality. This was our best airbnb experience to date.
1365882,6852895,,7449596,Kent,"Quiet location on a tree lined lane was nice. The apt. was clean and adequate in many ways. It was not, however, deluxe or high end. There was no glassware except for two cheap disposable plastic glasses. There was no way to make coffee. The apartment was absent decoration which gave the impression of being in the process of either moving in or moving out. The lighting was terrible.<br/>The bed was comfortable.<br/>No basic supplies which meant that to keep the apartment tidy ALL cleaning supplies had to be purchased for a short stay.<br/>The apartment has the potential to be quite nice."
39817809,578781657,,74496920,Noah,"Kerry, thank you for being so accommodating. We all greatly enjoyed our stay at your home - the place exceeded my expectations, and the location and amenities are hard to beat. We'd love to stay there again."
12934096,78684352,,74549452,Qingle,"It's my first time using Airbnb and I have to say that it's an amazing experience. The room is clean and spacious and the price is totally worthy.<br/>Melissa is very nice. She introduced the neighbor and told me everything I needed to know."
14103694,113126817,,74554534,Heather,Amazing! Awesome house. Kitchen and hot tub were spectacular!
34756492,506574335,,74640333,Joe,Marianne’s place was a great spot for me and a few family members to stay close to everything in Seattle. Marianne greeted us when we arrived and left food for us. Would stay here again.
47978078,730596947,,74687192,Kayla,"This little oasis is cozy, charming and packed with all the thoughtful touches that you'd want in B&B. I had to book a stay in a pinch due to a plumbing issue in my Seattle home and Kabino's place was the perfect match. I loved that the stay had a driveway right outside the door (a luxury for a city-dweller!), a really nice bathroom, fully operable kitchen and wifi that was fast enough to support 3 days worth of zoom meetings. I would recommend and rebook in a heartbeat!"
9974658,79739639,,74792858,Juan,"Everything was great. The place is nice and Rachelle very polite. My only complaint is the lack of wifi. Also, young people should know that this place is in a beautiful but very residential area."
28932291,602401233,,74872020,Tami,Great place and nice hostess!
3061918,13386373,,7488141,Reinhold,"Having made last minute changes in our travel plans, Scott was eager to accommodate our needs. With prior approval, he even allowed our small dog to accompany us. His house is located within walking distance to restaurants, shops, and Rapid Transit to downtown Seattle. We had our own entrance which was easily accessible. <br/>Scott greeted us at the prearranged time and gave us a tour and the key to his home. The bedroom was located in the finished basement with an adjacent sitting room equipped with large flat screen tv for our use. <br/>Even though we left early each morning and returned in the evening we felt we could have easily spent more time relaxing in Scott's home."
46308452,761827020,,74888298,Carol,The deck for the upper unit provides for spectacular views of the Seattle skyline. The yard is beautifully landscaped. Easy commute from the airport. Good communication from the host. Easy check-in and checkout process.
8630702,95358956,,75026460,Niki,"This place was conveniently located and a great place to stay for our family of four. We had all the conveniences of being in a home with a full kitchen. The beds were super comfy and the keyless entry made it easy to get in and out of without worrying about where the keys were or making sure it was returned. The newly renovated features was an extra bonus, with dimmers making bedtime for the kids a breeze. My favorite, the suitcase racks...just like a hotel!"
24022914,318528544,,75035703,Cassandra,"When my husband and I arrived to Sarahs ABnb she came outside with her husband to greet us and introduce us to the ABnb. They came inside and chatted with us for a moment but quickly gave us our privacy after. (Which was appreciated after traveling all day) Her ABnb was stylish, modern, with very convenient amenities. The bed is very comfortable and there is a fully stocked kitchen. We messaged Sarah on Abnb, after our arrival, and asked for restaurant recommendations. She replied very quickly. We also LOVED the coffee house Sarah recommended that was within walking distance. Both my husband and I would HIGHLY recommend this location! We loved it!"
26207740,281434147,,75059168,Ashita,"Liz is a wonderful host and we had a pleasant stay. The place was neat, modern and quiet. It was also equipped with basic necessities like a coffee machine, plates, mugs, soap and towels. Laundry machines are also available upon request. There is also a parking spot available in front of the house. Liz was also very quick in responding to any questions we had. I would definitely recommend this place for anyone coming to explore seattle."
46798760,715905396,,75191625,Apryl,This is an awesome spot if you want to be in the heart of Seattle! So many amazing restaurants and shops all within walking distance. <br/>The building is very safe with guest access only. The hosts are communicative and amenities were plentiful.
15885497,113780459,,75203493,Caroline,"Pete and Anna are very nice hosts. They gave us a list of the best places to eat around the apartment, and gave us information about Seattle. <br/>As it was raining, they even gave us umbrellas ! <br/><br/>Our stay in Seattle was perfect !"
20601895,209213149,,75476627,Veronica,Wonderful! Great communication and super cute place!
20983058,210907975,,75503704,Ruben,"Ken & Evie's place is the best value you can get for your money. <br/>Environment:<br/>You get the pace and quietness that comes from living outside (10-15 minute drive) of a buzzing city. After a day packed with activities downtown, there's nothing like going back home to comfy blankets and a warm drink for some downtime. And the next morning get to see the skyline of Seattle while you drive in for another day of adventures.<br/>House:<br/>Something I liked of the house is that the guest suite is above ground, so you won't be living in a cold dark basement. The house is located in a calm neighborhood, with nice nature light coming in. There are two bedrooms with queen beds and the comfiest blankets you've ever had in a hotel/airbnb. There's a full kitchen, with a coffee machine, fridge connected to a spacious living area. The bathroom is fully stacked with extra toothbrushes, soap and soft towels. Basically your home far away from home.<br/>Recommendations:<br/>Park on 13th street in front of the house since there's no parking in the driveway (since it is a small driveway to enter a couple of properties). If you are driving in to drop off your luggage, back in instead of driving in normally because is hard to get out on reverse.<br/>If you are into cats, ask Ken or Evie about Lady Spooks. my group fell in love with the cat who stooped by to welcome us on our first night."
12490714,88059238,,75570094,Henry,"Very nice cozy home, with full furnish and supply, especially the kitchen, where we found all kinds of sources. Very detailed notes and advice from the host upon check-in. Neighbors are kind and helpful."
33252187,503332929,,75624808,Samantha,"Sarah's place was fantastic. It's such a cute place and honestly we wanted to live there. It's about a 30 minute walk to Pikes Market, and is in walking distance to a bunch of other great places near by. It's in a great neighborhood, and checking in was also very easy. Will definitely stay here again."
12518952,83280348,,75667814,Jackie,"Joe made us feel very welcome and even stocked the fridge with some pizzas and had flowers, coffee and wine on the table to welcome us. He was very responsive to our needs and his basement apartment home was clean and well stocked, which made our stay very enjoyable. The location is amazing, right across the street from Greenlake with lots to do. The gardens, beautiful flowers, fountain and hot tub in the side yard were wonderful to enjoy and very peaceful. High recommend!"
28249646,346753326,,75671386,Shannon,"We had a wonderful stay at Amy and Ian’s place. They went above and beyond to provide a welcoming retreat and make sure we had everything we needed. The kitchen was well stocked, the apartment was cozy and cute, and the location was convenient for getting around West Seattle (and beyond)!"
368403,7860224,,7570404,Ken,Great space and host! We had a very positive experience using this home for our research and language study.
6761092,9.42E+17,,75832481,José,Great place with everything that was necessary and more. Very private and safe.
13451352,81436033,,75922274,McKenna,Great location. Very cute and cozy place. Really enjoyed my stay! Thank you again!
1494828,6901543,,7594187,Christine,"We absolutely LOVED our stay! The accommodations were NEW and very fresh and inviting. This was WAY better than staying in a hotel. We entertained twice for dinner and everyone just loved the condo. It is very well equipped for kitchen and bath purposes and we had plenty of seating for our dinner guests. The pictures do not do the condo justice. The location was most convenient for our travels between downtown and the Lynnwood area. Very easy to walk to places to eat and or pick up items needed down the hill near Lake Union.<br/><br/>This was our first experience with Airbnb and we will definitely book again, we may even try to reserve this Cool and Convenient Eastlake condo next time to Seattle. William was very easy in our correspondence and very timely in his reply's. Our key was mailed to our home before our departure. It was all very smooth and uncomplicated."
7.15E+17,7.6E+17,,7608982,Ellie,"Ashley’s place was just perfect for our trip to the art show at Magnuson Park. It’s in a nice location, is clean and modern and within walking distance to coffee shops and a few restaurants. It’s a tight squeeze walking around the bedroom but worth it to have a queen bed. We look forward to staying here again!"
41601649,602733059,,76210184,Don/Cat,The instructions are overwhelming but accurate and easier than they sound.
12682044,94230257,,76219248,Geneal K,"The listing for this Airbnb was spot on. The pictures were accurate as to it's spaciousness. It contained everything that was listed in it's profile. We <br/>very much appreciated the binder listing history of the building, local attractions to see, and restaurants to eat at. We were able to talk with our host on a couple of occasions and found him to be pleasant and helpful.<br/>Our accommodations made our visit with family perfect."
1023693,6255871,,7627536,Diane,"Shannon was an absolute dream to rent from. She outfitted the apartment with all kinds of personal touches to make us feel so welcomed and comfortable. From great pre-trip communication to the hand-written welcome card, to the lovely selection of vintage records and games, to the extremely comfortable, luxurious bed, to inviting us spontaneously to enjoy the backyard on a particularly warm evening, to all the really great local recommendations, directions, maps, contact info that she meticulously arranged....to to to....there is too much to mention! She made our first trip to Seattle completely wonderful. Next time we visit that beautiful city, we will hope to be able to stay in her awesomely inspiring space. Thanks so much Shannon and happy trails until we meet again!"
1603408,7426220,,7631684,Alex,"Melissa was great. She was very flexible and let me extend my stay not once, but twice. The apartment was good, especially at the price point. If you're looking for luxury, stay somewhere else (somewhere more expensive). But if you're looking for a basic space in an incredibly convenient location, this is a great place."
8194782,46812083,,7634188,Josh,"Holly, Forrest and their kids were incredibly welcoming for our first visit to Alki Beach. The newly renovated above-garage apartment is perfectly nestled across from a park and just a block from the beach. Adorable decor, clean and fully-equiped and a super comfy bed! The apartment is stocked with essentials for a great two night getaway or a relaxing week trip. My wife and I were expecting a cute little spot but we were definitely blown away by the fantastic Alki Beach Hideaway. We will stay here every time we come back to Seattle. <br/><br/><br/><br/>"
1355094,6142635,,7635094,Robert,"Michael was incredibly friendly and accommodating, but even though I was essentially living in someone else's home, at no point did I feel unwelcome or uncomfortable. He even invited me out to a party which allowed me to socialise within minutes of arriving in the city.<br/><br/>I didn't actually get to meet everyone in the apartment as they are all busy people and I found myself busy too, but it was a nice clean space in a pretty hip and fun area. The room was comfortable with a desk and closet space and some handy guidebook which I probably should have used. I had my privacy, but was also able to ask Michael for info and he always was happy to oblige. <br/><br/>Overall, a genuinely good experience. I happily recommend."
7331079,42721472,,7648229,Vivien,?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????<br/>A wonderful house for family especially with kids. The district is quite and safe. Green lake is within walk distance. I will stay there again when I visit Seattle next time.
35735114,518499836,,76612313,Alina,"I have to give Andrew’s Airbnb 5 stars in every way. The space was even better in person, and Andrew added thoughtful touches to the space including a super organized guidebook. He communicated clearly and quickly so we had no issues. Everything we needed was already there, ranging from plenty of kitchenware to a laundry unit! The easy street parking and comfy, stylish living area were MAJOR pluses. I look forward to another stay here if I’m back in Seattle!"
21175123,202991778,,7661523,Shana,"Brian is an amazing host and so kind! We had an issue with the apartment that was completely beyond his control, just a fluke incident, and he went above and beyond to rectify the situation. He gave us excellent customer service and the apartment was located downtown and within walking distance to most everything. Thank you, Brian!"
49345319,751573010,,76632745,Angelia,Very cute historic location. We enjoyed our stay and the adjacent cafe.
37112808,4.17E+17,,76640775,Denise,Great value house in a quiet neighborhood where you can walk your dog. Secure fenced backyard. The TV entertainment area is great with recliners and a huge screen. Beds are comfortable. We had a heat wave and they had put portable aircon in the main bedroom which made a big difference.
29775779,416598527,,76663983,Cherina,"Good location, good correspondence but the place wasn’t very clean upon arrival. The price was good as well."
20095739,175767840,,76673834,Shelly,"We loved the space and the price of this airbnb. We came to town to see a Mariners game and were just 15 minutes from Safeco Field. The house was great and they were so accommodating of our schedule that kept changing. They communicated well with us and were so friendly when we arrived. When we woke up in the morning we realized we slept in much longer than expected because the room was quiet, comfortable and relaxing! <br/>They have an incredible set up for breakfast and they provide milk, toast, eggs, snacks, coffee etc! Who wouldn't want to stay where they serve you breakfast also?! <br/>We loved staying here and plan on booking his place every time we come to the game!"
7789438,46451979,,767129,Dena,Shay made me feel right at home. Very accommodating. The apartment was cozy and decorated in great taste! I will definitely rent this again when I return to Seattle.
9803484,89588204,,76813955,Karyn,"Karen was a very gracious hostess. Even though she wasn't in town during our visit, she was always available through text, the AirBnB app, or phone calls. Karen gave me excellent instructions for getting into the home, and the home was beautifully clean, and in order, with chocolates on our pillows. (My 11 year old son particularly loved the chocolates.)<br/><br/>The house was so clean, matched the pictures perfectly, and had a lovely view of the water from the master bedroom, and the living room. We loved the neighborhood, and enjoyed walking the beach and taking walks down to get Gelato. Having Karen's condo to stay in made our visit to Seattle that much more fantastic!!"
1114695,5184330,,76825,Clay,"Cool place, there are a ton of great restaurants nearby and you can get on the bus easily if you want to go downtown to the market or other touristy stuff. House really stands out!"
25781184,279794211,,77008223,Laurel,"lovely, spacious basement apartment with nice light from several high windows. well appointed and thoughtfully designed. nice outdoor space. walking distance to great shopping and dining. quiet pretty neighborhood. gracious host. easy uber to downtown."
51267465,8.81E+17,,77016599,J'Amy,It was the perfect location to explore Capitol Hill and Seattle.
33286578,441353297,,77023344,Raul,Rebecca’s home is gorgeous and has everything you will need! Walking distance to some great food & coffee shops. Plus only 10-15 minute drive to downtown Seattle.
20889482,194350287,,77055284,?,We stay there for two days and have a good experience. The landscape is very beautiful and the living environment is quite and clean. 15 minutes drive distance to the downtown. Highly recommended!
8.03E+17,8.44E+17,,77268133,Valerie,"Thanks so much! The space was beautiful and thoughtfully stocked. We appreciated how comfortable the beds were, the cleanliness, and the coziness."
20647832,203833525,,77500646,Staci,"This home is clean, modern and bright! The layout was great, the kitchen and baths are beautiful, and it was great having so many bathrooms with showers! We had a great stay and loved the enclosed yard for our kids. Communication with Fifi was quick and easy."
13273883,82422789,,77508769,Gerry & Becki,"This converted garage suite was brand new with top notch amenities. It was very convenient to downtown Seattle and it was in a nice quiet neighborhood. Graham, Debra and their son were very sweet and helpful."
13607307,82881679,,77600692,Ada,"Great value for the location & condition of the room, amenities. Old house with 3 rooms all used for AirBnb so if you want a homey-feel this is not for you but if you need to be close to the University area or Children's Hospital this is a great option with direct bus access across the street and close to a 24-hr supermarket. The room was clean, comfortable, as advertised. Includes many amenities not always offered such as free soda/water, toothpaste, work desk & basic office supplies. Host does not live here but quick with communication.<br/>For improvement & consideration for some folks:<br/>*One shared bath so there may be up to 3-6 people at one time between three rooms and it could really use more cleaning. The only downside is if you really need to pee in the morning and someone is in the shower for 30minutes. <br/>*Busy, popular neighborhood = traffic noise. Location is next block from a fire station so there's siren noise from that, sometimes in middle of the night. the bus stop is right outside this room window, with very frequent service and it could be pretty loud for some people."
13085197,186884516,,77617242,Thej,Nice location. Great Host (Melissa partners with her guests). As described.
50900084,4.32E+17,,77617251,Megan,We had a great experience. The place was clean and it had everything we needed in the kitchen. It was close to the areas we visited.
40370789,628004752,,77768311,Livia,"This unit is in a beautiful, quiet, and safe neighborhood! The home was very cozy, clean, and private from the upstairs home (as it is blocked off from the upstairs portion of the residents living space) Carla was very prompt about responding to any of my messages, and was very sweet when interacting with her outside of the unit.<br/>The location was perfect. A short drive to Golden Gardens Park, a distant view of downtowns skyline, and a glimpse of mountains at the street end. Also close proximity to a lot of restaurants, breweries, and cafes (walking distance even)<br/>There was a kuerig coffee maker, and K cups provided, which I was pleasantly surprised by! <br/>Very sweet, unique little place!"
45298799,732024807,,77817748,John,"Absolutely lovely stay. Great neighborhood, great views, great place. Yep~"
28220417,321200274,,77974668,Hillary,"Wow, what a beautiful place! Description of this place it to a T. Michelle was so accommodating when we had to book last minute due to an error with another host. She even set up the sofa bed for us before we arrived so we could just fall into bed. Communication and check in were quick and easy. Would definitely recommend this place!"
10880656,99704500,,77988686,Jee Woong,Had great experience staying at Annie & Dan's place. Very clean and nice little downstairs unit. Would definitely stay again!
24479408,276114717,,78126086,Gail,"Beautiful spacious loft. Excellent location. Host had timely, friendly communication and welcomed us upon arrival. Definitely a Seattle gem!"
13032264,83125793,,78144324,Judy,"We loved staying in this little cottage. It was just perfect. Everything we needed was there. The owners made great use of the space available to them. Everything was brand new and it was nice to stay somewhere that was immaculate. Thanks, Greg and Mary for a wonderful time."
13083601,92686570,,78193294,Kathryn,"Andrew was an AMAZING host! My family and I drove from California and arrived at 1:30am and had issues getting the key (our error, not his) and he answered my call and was so nice and accommodating even though I was calling him in the middle of the night. The place looked exactly like the pictures and the view off the balcony was awesome! My in laws, husband and I loved staying here and would definitely recommend it and stay again in the future. The location was great and close to everything we wanted to see in Seattle. Choosing to book with Andrew and stay here was 100% a better decision than getting a hotel room. This was my first time using AirBnB and I will definitely do it again and hope all hosts are as good as Andrew was with accommodating and responding promptly. If you book with him you won't regret it!"
41907357,625163371,,78283962,Diane,"The apartment was very easy to find and self check in was very straight forward. The space was very clean, stylish, and comfy feel to it! It had everything I needed to have a comfortable stay, smart tv, cookware, clean linens and a comfy couch and super comfy bed. Also it was conveniently located a block a way from the grocery store and transit station. Thanks again for hosting!"
5084451,80565600,,78366694,Alexander,Our host made us feel incredibly welcomed. We came in incredibly last minute and she was very polite and friendly despite this being both of our first times using the app. She provided a bed for us to sleep in and offered us food and fresh towels for the next morning. Her dog was incredibly friendly and her roommate was also very nice. They both told us about the many sights Seattle had to offer and were more than willing to show us them. I could not have asked for a better first experience using Air BNB
48070057,758429866,,78376407,Bodhisatta,"I cannot help but write a negative review although the place is nice, and spacious. <br/>My negative review is mainly due to the way guest handling was done in the name of being “professional”. <br/>The host clearly needs to learn how to be more courteous. I made a mistake while booking in mentioning the number of guests (instead of two, I had mentioned one). But well before my arrival I shared all my details and and was also made to pay extra for changing the number of guests. Finally, I paid nearly $1200 for an 11 day stay. That’s almost as much as a hotel was charging. Even after that the host repeatedly behaved as if I am purposely conning my way into her property. <br/>Extremely disappointed to find the host to be unhelpful. Even for simple things, I was told to figure things out and if I needed some additional help a charge of $65 will be added to my bill. <br/>At the time of check out, the host created an unnecessary confusion by not explicitly clarifying the check-out process. Two persons messaged - creating a confusion. I thought some team will be coming at the time of check out to see if everything was fine. I waited. 15-20 mins post my check out time when the team did not arrivei messaged and got a reply that I have to pay extra because the cleaning team is waiting etc etc. <br/>Much more...don’t have time to elaborate.<br/>The room and the facilities were otherwise fine."
28027896,324277487,,7852037,Pete,"Happy and her dog Sosuke are amazing hosts, and their home is warm, welcoming, and comfortable. Just like in the AirBnB description, the natural lighting and open floor plan make for a light and roomy space. Happy really cares to make your stay an enjoyable one, going the extra mile to provide superior quality, name-brand coffee, tea, and shower products. Their home is perfectly located in a quiet neighborhood that is a quick 10-15 minute walk from numerous cafes, restaurants, and grocers. Also, Green Lake is only two blocks away, and offers a walking/biking trail, kayaking, canoeing, and even a few yoga/fitness studios. Downtown Seattle is 15-20 minutes by car, so you're not so far removed from the big city activities. In summary, Happy and Sosuke will make your visit to Seattle comfortable, easy, and relaxing."
19508222,167451074,,78651159,Lois,"Location a short walk above Gas Works Park made Wallingford perfect for Seattle Fireworks Display on July 4. While we did not meet Sara (and Eric) personally, a friend on the premises at the time of our arrival helped us deal with the number/key entry. ""Tiny House"" was exactly as pictured, spotless and packed with thoughtful extras."
13940437,88907085,,78695717,Mike,"The cottage had a parking spot right in front, with a light on, which was great for arrival after long travels. The kitchen was stocked with various goodies including fresh blackberries and coffee.<br/><br/>The cottage is very bright, modern, and neat, with skylights and open space, in addition to a clean bathroom and storage space. It is located about a 5 minute walk from great coffee, cupcakes, and brunch. <br/><br/>It was the ideal home base for my wife, child, and I to enjoy our stay in the city of Seattle."
12473960,73301068,,7872696,Wilson,My stay was perfect! Lara was an awesome host and made sure I had everything I needed. The location was also great and super convenient since it was just a short walk to the shops and restaurants in Fremont. Would definitely recommend!
7247518,38785054,,7902103,Michael,"Angie was an absolute dream. A wonderful host and a warm, welcoming person all around. Her home was just that, it felt like home. Very cute. Nicely decorated, and clean, it made us feel like we actually lived there for the time we stayed. It was easy to Uber in and out of downtown from the place and was in a super nice, safe, quite neighborhood. I would certainly recommend this place to anyone who is looking for an affordable and spacious place to stay during a trip to Seattle. It was a big part of me falling in love with the city! I'll be back soon! <br/>Thanks Angie"
31444663,428255706,,79071469,Selina,"My boyfriend and I stayed in Bernard's air bnb for two nights and couldn't have asked for a better experience. The suite is lovely and is the perfect size for 2 people. Bernard is so helpful, friendly, and (as my boyfriend said it) a really cool guy! He greeted us when we arrived and made us feel welcome and cared for. He had helpful guest information printed for us and the unit was stocked with everything we could have needed. The bed was very comfortable! As a sweet bonus, we were treated with some delicious chocolate, fruits, and a fridge stocked with drinks. The unit is located in a lovely complex and is quite central to downtown. <br/>We were so happy to be his first guests and would stay here again in a heartbeat!"
22800261,483727629,,79183911,Carina,"Great location, family friendly. Would stay again."
1531351,6800326,,792512,Michele,"Perfect location, comfortable, studio apartment. It reminded me of the places I stayed in college 20 years ago, but with anew frig and stove. Definitely an improvement from staying at a dumpy corporate hotel on the highway or paying 300.00 a night downtown. I would stay here again."
23877351,250038901,,79269075,Suzanne,"I’m originally from Seattle but I always enjoy a relaxing “staycation” for time to myself. Chris and his staff were very accommodating for my last minute booking and even left me a little surprise for my stay! Just like the listing states, it is right next to a highway but the noise didn’t bother me, it’s more a soft hum. I felt very comfortable here, the linens were fresh and soft and I melted right in. The outdoor patio overlooked the beautiful Lake Union which gave me a perspective I hadn’t yet seen in my 20+ years in Seattle, and was perfect for reading books outside for the warm weather we had. Even though the building is older, the building has a unique historical charm that we rarely see in Seattle anymore, and reminded me of when I first moved out here haha:) I would definitely stay here the next I decide I’m due for a little “staycation”. Thanks for a relaxing stay Chris!"
12672933,82620355,,79317245,Christine,"We rented the house because of the gourmet kitchen and Sara's home did not disapppoint. If your family is like mine, we love to cook and eat.<br/><br/>The location is perfect. Its 10 min from downtown and pike place, 12 min from Green Lake. Its a very quiet and quaint neighbourhood. <br/><br/>The home slept 5 people and can accomodate 2 more on the couch. The only challenge was that there was only one bathroom and when you have teenagers its definitely a challenge<br/><br/>Oh and the deck in the back was amazing"
6.43E+17,6.51E+17,,79345560,Rebekka,This is a beautiful home. Every luxury you could wish for is here- including heated floors in the owners bathroom! We would happily stay here again.
13532046,86440528,,79508285,Manisha,"Kelly was awesome and more than accommodating as I was not personally staying in the house, but only making arrangements for team members from out of the country were staying there and she met all of our needs and checked in during their stay. The group had nothing but wonderful things to say and said the prefer their stay at Kelly's AIRBNB to a hotel any day. It allowed them to have business meals together at the house and have all the amenities of being at home. THANK YOU!!!!!"
44391446,3.89E+17,,7953154,Kristina,"Absolutely loved Brad's place. Great location, super comfortable place, well-stocked with everything we needed, and Brad was very communicative and helpful throughout our stay."
49679750,768394088,,79659018,Kevin,"This was a good place to stay while searching for apartments in Fremont. It's fairly quiet on a top floor, the area is convenient with stores and restaurants nearby, and Melissa is a very helpful host."
22493797,427072373,,79674068,Barbara,Fun little place to stay. Great layout for a studio space.<br/>Walking distance to grocery & across the street from Subway for late night nibbles.<br/>No parking issues. Park located just north for getting those steps!<br/>Loved the quirky bears.
48214818,737381706,,79939619,Sheila,"Beautiful place, loved the decor, and the view was amazing! Loved the cute table with the view so much that we ordered take out and had a nice dinner in. Very convenient location, Ubers were 10-20 dollars. Very clean place. Has everything you will need except toothpaste. <br/>Host was very communicative. Check in and check out were simple. <br/>Wish my stay was longer and I’d definitely book again! <br/>FYI, make sure to always lock the door behind you as you go in/out (I know...that’s obvious) Sometimes it seemed like someone was trying the door handle but we later found out that it’s just changes in pressure in the building when people walk in/out of their places. Remember, it is a city!"
50676959,5.91E+17,,79978,Bonnie,Absolutely loved my stay at Casa Ballard! They made my first visit to Seattle so incredible and relaxing — the place was sparkling clean and felt like a forest oasis. They clearly thought of all the details and made the stay so comfortable from check-in through check-out. Will definitely be my first choice for any future trips back.
14220168,194385666,,800220,Jewels,Great place they are friendly and helpful. I was satisfied with the hospitality.
6.09E+17,7.08E+17,,80063647,Laura,"This clean and open basement space worked well for my son and I during our short visit to Seattle. It's in a great, walkable neighborhood with excellent cafes and restaurants nearby. Kathleen has a lovely home and allows guest to enjoy the backyard in privacy. I appreciated her morning check in and afternoon out - as it allowed for more flexibility during our stay. This policy is a real perk. She is a gracious host - both responsive and helpful. I definitely would recommend it."
29182677,463677973,,8012294,Austin,"The place was absolutely gorgeous, with lots of wonderful personal touches like radiant heated floors! Although the place is smaller than some homes, they really laid it out beautifully fitting in everything you might want such as a washer/dryer, a desk, and windows to capture the wonderful view of the lake. There was also an outside patio that was just the place for your morning coffee. They provided a personalized book that was everything you would want to know about both the Madrona area and where to go in Seattle. The hosts were extremely warm and gracious, introducing us to their dog and also providing some cold beverages and a bottle of wine! The location was wonderful! There are some very good restaurants just a few blocks away and there is a fun set of stairs down to the beach! The place was beautifully decorated and a nice quiet place to stay, we will definitely book here again!!"
1493349,6575277,,8013007,Jeffrey,"Considering that this was my first time using AirBnB, Melissa accepted my request without any hassel or reservation. The apartment posted was exactly what I got. A place that was comfortable , clean and roomy. The property was on the first floor and in front, making it easy to find and commute in and out. I really enjoyed my time spent there and would recommend the apartment to someone looking for a pleasant clean living area in a great location.<br/><br/>Thanks! Melissa<br/>"
16602889,128555686,,8013961,Chris,This is a very tidy and comfortable place. The bed was comfortable and the location was very convenient to the local restaurants yes the street was quiet.
2882641,13431711,,8025820,Katie,The house was exactly as described. It is very comfortable and quiet. It was way more inviting and homey than staying in a hotel. I love the neighborhood! Capitol Hill is so fun and vibrant! There are great bars and restaurants all within walking distance. There is a bus stop just on the other block that runs straight to downtown. We used UBER the whole time we were there and it was very convenient. We loved staying at Adam's home. He is very accommodating and so nice. He had fresh flowers waiting for us when we arrived. We will definitely be staying here again!!!
38626919,569779722,,80290175,Steve,"Place was sparkling clean, great hospitality, quick responses, and host was helpful with area tips."
13175944,84863920,,80378994,Stacey,"Loved this place!!! The Bunglow is cozy and very comfortable, clean, well-stocked, and in a great location! The Fremont neighborhood is trendy and fun, and not too far from downtown. Tracy and Tom are exceptional hosts with great communication and very nice. We really enjoyed our stay here and will definitely be back."
1539463,7946325,,8043355,Dagný,"My boyfriend and I spent a week with Rainer. His house is very big and beautiful and the bedroom we had upstairs was big and comfy. We had our own bathroom that was across the hall. Rainer was incredibly helpful and gave us endless tips on where best to shop, what was best to see and so on. The house is pretty close to downtown, and we walked there almost every day, only half an hour or so, but there are also buses that go straight downtown in a walking distance of 2 minutes. The dog is a big sweetheart, and we absolutely loved having her there. We had the most incredible time there and Seattle is a great city. I would definitely recommend this place!"
19384198,168566066,,80497792,Jasper,Great little basement apartment in awesome green lake location!
43958243,670588913,,80548013,Sanjay,"Stayed for about a month. Excellent place, very spacious and clean. Lots of natural light, great location and view.<br/>Wifi speed and reliability could be better."
18375018,150371282,,80744274,Matthew,"You would never believe me if I told you exactly HOW AWESOME this place and these hosts are. I have stayed at over a dozen AirBNB locations and I've never felt like I got this much of the royal treatment. Literally every single detail of the unit is clean, high-quality and attractive, yet it doesn't feel like a fake, flipped house. This is genuinely luxurious, and also fun and fully stocked. Amazon echo was serenading us as we walked in, champagne and a welcome card awaited us. Condiments in the kitchen. One of those crazy multi-head extra large showers. Super high quality mattress, sheets, furniture, art. It was like a homey and comfortable version of a fancy Vegas high-roller suite. <br/>Take note: this is how it's done, this is the high water mark."
27984069,318465411,,80819642,Aubree,"Our stay was everything we hoped for and more! From the moment we arrived it felt cozy. Mary was super helpful and welcoming (and it was awesome to meet little Sancho too!). We had privacy, but she also made it clear that if we needed anything at all that we just needed to reach out. Communication was fast and the place itself was very stylish and wonderful. Really enjoyed our stay here and would happily stay again!"
18849203,185109236,,8082403,Marta,"Rob's place was fantastic! It was clean, spacious, and easy to navigate in terms of checking in and out. Rob was super responsive and very accommodating. Thank you!!!"
36634976,517705683,,8090846,Christoph,"Superior airbnb apartment. The best airbnb we had on our 2,5 weeks trip in the US and Canada. This airbnb is modern, super clean, well located and comfortable. The king size bed is amazing. Michelle is a great host. She offered beer, water, tee, coffee, juice, lemonade and yogurt, milk and cereal for self service breakfast. <br/>The apartment even has a modern washing machine a dryer and a TV. <br/>It's well located in a safe and beautiful neighbourhood. It's just 20 minutes to the airport and 10 minutes to the city centre. The apartment is in the basement, but with the windows you don't really recognise it. This is just the perfect airbnb apartment."

13021356,84080987,,81194246,Michael,"Monica was a genuinely engaged and kind host. Whether you want to lay low or bounce ideas off her, Monica is eager to oblige. Her space is elegant and modern, just like her attitude."
11619498,72594300,,8129220,Alex,"Cate was quick to respond to my inquiry and repeatedly reached out to make sure that I would feel comfortable arriving and staying in her Airbnb. The place was exactly as pictured, very clean, and well kept. The neighborhood is incredibly beautiful and very close to downtown. I was completely satisfied with my experience in Cate's place and recommend it to anyone who wants to stay near the heart of Seattle."
46679642,721736824,,81298028,Ryan,Karen was very informative regarding the local guidelines and restrictions! It gave us a good idea on what to expect for the city. She also saved the day for us on our check out. Thank you so much for taking care of us!
22267394,226270995,,81309938,Jason,"It was perfect for what we were looking for - proximity to Pike Place Market. Very easy walk to Pike Place and the many restaurants - no need to drive! Walked up for coffee and fresh pastries in the morning and enjoyed great food and drinks at night! We really enjoyed the comfortable, relaxed, and secure feel of the place. We had an amazing time and definitely plan to be back!"
32590821,434391715,,81478596,Sarah,"Really grate place to stay, I spent my first two weeks in Seattle there before to find a permanent place. The place is really convenient, with lot of facilities and the location is great as it's just right close to a really nice park, really quite then, and also really close to stores and the University area! The host Manisha is really helpful if needed!"
598023,6409632,,815392,Diego,Jeff is a very friendly host. We had the chance to go out together for lunch to the beach area and spend a great time!. Thank you Jeff for opening the doors of your house. And also a big hugh for Pilot your lovely dog. See you soon.
37132009,506565889,,81647205,Matthew,Great apartment in a really nice quiet location but only a short walk to all the fun stuff at Capitol Hill
8505940,48654382,,8165305,Aileen,"We had a great time at David's house- he is quite the host! From fresh towels, morning coffee, and even home baked cookies, David provided everything! He has a lovely home in a beautiful neighborhood, close to downtown."
25372987,276416516,,8178287,Kc,"Gorgeous apartment in an ideal location near downtown Seattle. The hosts were super responsive and made sure everything was set up perfectly for our stay. The apartment is filled with lovely, thoughtful touches; I would definitely recommend!"
1541705,6999744,,8186715,Noah,"This place might be ideal for guys who doesn't care cleanness of the house and who are JUST looking for a place to sleep in the night. For me it was okay as I was out most of the day and came back late to sleep and also 24 hour Macdonald is 10-15 mins walk distance.<br/><br/>Basic facilities to live like a human are working fine. You could cook in the kitchen as they had many kitchen utensils. But to ladies it might not be ideal as you will be sharing the house with other 3 + guests mostly, if not all, guys in the house and some of them stayed there for more than a month. Also as I could not lock bathroom door, I had to put chairs behind the door when I had showers. Bathroom basin was a bit weird. It seems it was not completely blocked. But didn't go down until some level and that level was quite high so it looked like blocked...but I don't know maybe it was block. Anyway I used a kitchen basin to brush my teeth.<br/><br/>The room itself is better than other common places in the house. You will have a separate outdoor entrance door. So you will have two keys so you could lock both entrance door and door to the inside of the house. It is really spacious. 2 people can stay without any problem. Internet speed was okay. I was able to stream videos without difficulties."
25618985,291430891,,81897552,Ryan,"Kathleen and Randy are amazing. This was one of my best experiences with AirBnb. The location is perfect; near breweries, bars, walking trails, and good clean fun. The neighborhood is very family friendly, and quiet. The apartment is fantastic. Bathroom is nice, shower is big. Kitchen has everything you need! The garden is absolutely beautiful, with an amazing view. Kathleen has thought of absolutely everything to make a perfect stay!"
20666810,214895708,,8190310,Kari,This is a great place to stay in Fremont (Seattle). The house is beautiful and had everything we needed to celebrate a family Thanksgiving holiday. The neighborhood is quiet. Walking distance to plenty of places and shopping. Easy access to downtown and to I-5.
18690558,160578457,,81947513,Linda,Randy is very friendly and welcoming. He helped us with logistics . The neighborhood is in a good location for public transportation and restaurants. Being allowed to use the washer and dryer as well as the kitchen was a nice addition. If coming in with a car parking during the day is tricky but that is true of Seattle. Public transportation will get you where you need to go. Great experience.
32195610,410748708,,82169520,Paul,Very central to both downtown and The airport. The hosts were fantastic even when plumbing issues arose. Would absolutely stay again
15299612,164293077,,82344174,Christopher,Very comfortable bedding. High-end finishes throughout. Well equipped kitchen. The place was eat-off-the-floor spotless when we arrived. Easy street parking. Small patio with nicely planted yard very pleasant for morning coffee. Would definitely recommend and stay here again.

4211081,21990140,,8243019,Lynn,"Peter's Cozy Capitol Hill townhouse is a lovely space in a great, walkable, friendly location. The photos don't quite show the charm and accommodating size of the place. It is very inviting, super clean, modern, comfortable and was spacious for 3 adults sleeping separately. Peter was very gracious, always available, and even reached out during a storm to see if we needed candles or lanterns. We would certainly stay here again."
26334328,317838425,,824491,Dardie,Very comfy room in at the top of the stairs <br/>Downstairs bathroom is lovely with a claw foot tub and great shower head/water pressure.
5.88E+17,6.88E+17,,82585442,David,"Dave and Martha’s #UpOnTenth location is a gem. Beautifully remodeled and furnished place that felt warm and welcoming just outside of downtown Seattle. My group of 5 fit comfortably, and stayed cool with the wall unit air conditioners through the house during a particularly warm week in the pacwest. There was a great little porch facing the street that one of our friends took advantage of to read in the morning, and there’s a large backyard to entertain/ enjoy the sun. I’d live there if I could, but for now it’s a strong recommendation for anyone looking to stay in Seattle."
12423091,113778084,,8259516,Danielle,"Wow what can I even say!? The area is perfect and the house is beautiful! We stayed 2 nights and didn't have to drive over 2 miles to find the best coffee, donuts, restaurants and shopping. Not to mention the gorgeous lake around the corner. The house is minimalist and yet so cozy with amazing architecture and luxury details. By the end of our trip, we all wanted to move in. Oh yeah, and the hammock, just awesome. Bridget is kind and helpful and I love her quirky energy. If you want a real taste of Seattle, just know you will get it here. We woke up to rain one morning and the bamboo swaying outside our window was hypnotic. I could go on and on but I'll just say, this will always be where we will want to stay when we come back."
25316979,318892058,,8264543,Benjamin,"This is one of the finest places I've stayed... and I've been a frequent AirBnB guest for work and liesure travel for many years! Everything is new, convienient, and beautifully appointed! My client booked a condo for me on a gig in Downtown Seattle in which I was miserable, and thank God Andrew's place was available to save my week!"
1531458,6972299,,8266552,Maryelle,"Great location if you have to go to UW .Melissa was prompt to respond and made very easy and fast to get the papers work ready.<br/>That place is very quiet inside and out [no traffic at all ]<br/>The apartment is very clean and spacious.<br/>The balcony was wonderful to relax with a great view.<br/>Thank you Melissa.My daughter is at UW for 4 years i am sure i will rent from you again.<br/>Maryelle"
31593357,404607618,,826977,Melina,"Nityia's place is brand new, sparkling clean and comfortable! For my work trip to Seattle, her place was super easy to get to from the airport, close to I-5, light rail and neighborhoods with fun places to eat (George Town, Beacon Hill). Capitol Hill and Downtown are a short light rail ride away. The Nest bedroom has everything you need and more! Super cozy bed with lots of pillows, awesome shower, tons of outlets to plug in devices, and a great living room with work stations. Nityia was fast to reply to my questions and made check in a breeze! I'll definitely be staying here again."
35870877,578134746,,82902881,James,"My wife, son and I really enjoyed staying here. Beata was a great host who really opened up her home to us. She even was able to set up a full crib for our baby! <br/>The location is great - very close to restaurants and shops. I would recommend!"

You know those thoughts that linger around always when you book wondering if the place will be ever the same as it looks in photos? Well it was better than photos. Such details and interior looks great. Parking there and it’s a great place and hosts are so helpful, checking in if we are doing good. Had a welcome note and wine. Sweet!"
4439293,22386265,,8315524,Vanessa,The place was super cozy and very comfortable. The wireless speaker was very cool! And the best was they left us wine! And gave us free parking. The instructions were great! Great hosts!

1579615,7080797,,8403389,Soo,"Newly renovated building. It has its own kitchen, bathroom and s mall patio as well. When I stayed, there was no one in the building so I had quiet, cozy time. Having a designated parking is also a big plus!"
51844154,4.79E+17,,84155306,Kira,"Nice spot with a comfy feel, friendly and accessible host. Great amenities. A little bit of traffic noise, but there's white noise machines in the bedrooms that do a good job of muffling that out."
14084566,88683387,,84156139,Jo,"Everything about our experience was amazing! Room was spotless, bed was very comfortable, bathroom amazing, and the food was great! Jeanine truly makes you feel like family. They are very helpful and knowledgeable about the city. Great location, we took the light rail into city and it is a very short walk to station and short ride. Every morning Jeanine had breakfast ready (depending on day but we pastries, fresh fruit, smoothie, yogurt and granola, juice and coffee). When booking room she is very fast at responding to questions. When we come back to Seattle, I would love to stay here again."

34066096,466985300,,84522953,Kate,"We couldn’t have been any happier with our stay. The interior is beautiful and everything was clean and well kept. There were ample pillows and blankets on the beds and towels in the bathroom and kitchen. Beds were very comfortable. Having a washer / dryer in the home was a wonderful perk. <br/>The location was incredible. It was nice to be able to walk a few blocks to grocery stores, restaurants, and shopping. <br/>I would hands down stay here again or recommend it to any family or friends traveling to the area. <br/>Don was an incredible host!"
33246518,595760400,,84541555,Laura,"Peach's home is beautiful, the location is amazing, and the apartment has almost everything I could have asked for. There is no over but there is a toaster oven. Dishwasher and fridge are on the small side but usable none the less. All in all our three month stay was amazing and 10/10 I would stay again"
14716424,123107713,,8458768,Joshua,"Staying at Meade's home was a wholly wonderful experience! I rented the house to accommodate the entirety of my family during their first visit to Seattle, which happened to also be Christmas. Meade and his family were kind, thoughtful, and considerate at every turn--they even left up their Christmas tree so that we'd have a little holiday spirit! The whole experience went off without a hitch."
39317146,574849528,,84596077,Elizabeth,"This place is a walkable gem in West Seattle! I stayed for a month while my home was under renovation, and hosted my parents here when they visited Seattle for a week. The bright, spacious home had everything I needed for my extended stay and was sparkling clean, as well as comfortable. I loved being two blocks from the Junction with all the cute shops and restaurants, and having dedicated off-street parking was a huge plus. Rhonda was incredibly responsive and hospitable - she even offered to book a wine tour or have a private chef come cook for me! I highly recommend this home for its great amenities and excellent service provided by the host."
18728930,154093376,,8472702,Mojdeh,"This place is fantastic and Rob is a wonderful host! Close to green lake restaurants and shops, easy to get to, clean and spacious!"
34845472,459842078,,84727124,Christine,"Our stay in Alex & Jose’s place was perfect! The place was very cute, very clean, comfy and the location was amazing. We were walking/biking distance to EVERYTHING. They were also very flexible with our schedules. I would love to stay here again!"
4405139,24388831,,8477645,Cai,"We had a fabulous time renting this space. The unit seemed newly remodeled/reno'd and was quite modern. There was adequate space for 4 adults and we all had our own spaces within the house should we want some privacy.<br/>The unit itself is located in an incredible area of Seattle. It's about 4 blocks from a very popular part of Capital Hill and was only two blocks from a Safeway. <br/>We would absolutely stay here again and had a great visit. Yoshua was very easy to get a hold of and was very accommodating to our requests."
32269368,428173969,,84815855,Mitchel,"If you are a looking for a quality valued, centrally located room in the Wallingford neighborhood of Seattle, than look no further! The host lives in the house and you may see him from time to time, but also very respectful of your privacy. Andrew is a top notch host and a real great person, I highly recommend here."
17658016,140262030,,84817035,Nicole,"This place was so much more than I'd expected! High end finishes, professional pots and pans in the kitchen, yummy bed, big fireplace and flat screen tv. All the amenities in the bathrooms. And walking distance from all of the cool things to do in Seattle's hippest neighborhood. I would definitely stay here again"
1589732,7058454,,8490078,Victoria,"Melissa was fantastic! I arrived to the property early, and she went out of her way to make sure I was accomodated. The location is great if you need to the close to the U-district - everything is walking distance!"
11972509,99157682,,84952049,Hrant,"This room was fantastic! The location is perfect, especially for activities at UW."
22654864,248553810,,8504521,Travis,Great little place in a remodeled basement of an old Ballars craftsman. Best for one person or a couple. No real kitchen but great bathroom and very warm and cozy. It was perfect for me for a long two week stay. I'd stay here again.

49405256,756732118,,85372776,Mackenzie,"This charming basement apartment is located in a nice neighborhood about a block away from a local park. It is fairly close to city center with lots of food choices all within 15 minute drive. The apartment is the perfect cozy spot to come back to after a long day exploring the Seattle area. <br/>Just a heads up, the apartment gets warm fairly quickly. We turned the heat down in the bedroom and had to use a fan to cool it down at night. Other then that everything was perfect."
6187841,31838563,,855055,Ryan,"Everything about this trip to Seattle was amazing. The 2bd 2ba condo was in an amazing location, so easy to get to everything in Belltown. So many cool restaurants, bars, coffee shops, etc. We walked everywhere due to amazing weather all weekend. The Pikes Place market is about a 10 min walk south. <br/>The condo is immaculate, with great decor and ready for guests. We didn't have any issues. The beds were very comfortable and my wife is going to buy new pillows (the ones on the beds there were incredible). <br/>There is a great roof top deck that overlooks the bay and we had a cocktail up there one night for the sunset. <br/>Honestly, you cannot go wrong for this location and price. We'll definitely book here again next time in Seattle."
48684543,747473839,,8550715,James,"Comfy and central, the apartment was warm and functional. Melissa was responsive and helpful"
6644760,41684066,,855816,Bill,Marc was in touch as we were arriving and indicated how to get to his place. A very peaceful and quiet neighborhood with plenty of shops and restaurants to s\chose from . He met us on arrival and showed us in . A very comfortable and complete and well furnished apartment with everything. Turned out to be the best choice for us. We both like to cook our own food. And cook we did. Marc gave us easy tips on how to get around. And was always available. I would recommend and certainly return to this perfect spot for Noi and me..He even offered to take me to my meeting at Washington University when the taxi never showed up..
7692281,167759174,,85661710,Alex,"Great host, great location, enjoyed my stay!"
41701444,5.25E+17,,8567696,Ron,"Great unit, great location, great gym. Loved the decor. The unit came with some coffee, tea and laundry and dishwasher detergent, which was nice.<br/>However, the level of service was below expectations, especially given that this is a management company, not a person. The responses to emails (which is their encouraged means of communication - they only provide a phone number for emergency) were often not timely. Also, the package delivery mechanism relies on the management company forwarding notifications to us - which they sometimes did, sometimes after a delay of a day or 2 (!!!), and sometimes never. Fortunately the building management (which is another company, from which Blueground leases the space) cared enough to notice the problem and to manually deliver packages to our room. So, there's a lot of room for improvement on the management side, especially given the high end look and feel of the building and the price point."
29418584,348413509,,85683525,Rebecca,Beautiful home with wonderful amenities!

37863703,523026623,,86532240,Raquel,"Michelle and Mike's apartment is an adorable little place! While it is attached to their house, it has a separate entrance and very little noise made it down to our floor. It's clear that they thought of every little thing you might need-- from olive oil and spices, to spare blankets and towels! We were able to find anything that we needed. <br/>The area around the apartment is also very nice and convenient! There is plenty of parking, and the lake is a very quick walk away. Plus, getting to downtown or to the airport was a straightforward drive. Michelle also sent over some recommendations for nearby restaurants and bars, which was very helpful.<br/>We had an awesome time staying here. Thanks again! :)"
50252799,6.63E+17,,86573,Ratna,"Sarah is a great host. She and her son is very helpful and friendly. Their dog, Pongo, is a very well behave & calm dog.<br/>Her place is clean, cozy and has complete amenities to make our stay comfortable. The location is also convenient to go anywhere in Seattle, very close to the Light Trail train for easy trips to Seattle's attractions."
23256472,239442857,,86576546,Lance,"Don's place is amazing! It is a wonderful, modern space and is close to everything. We highly recommend Don's place!"
5.46E+17,9.4E+17,,86911544,Karla,"Lan's place was truly a home away from home for us. Lan was a wonderful communicator, responding almost instantly if we had any questions. Lan's place had two main things other area rentals don't have, two FULL bathrooms and air conditioning throughout. The air conditioning made for the best night's sleep since the temperature was over 80 degrees the entire week we were there. The space had all the basic amnenties such as a microwave, stove, dishwasher but Lan provided the personal touches of board games, books, full shampoo/conditioner, body wash. The apartment is at the back of the house so it is extremely quiet and relaxing. Lan's place will definitely be our go to rental whenever we return to Seattle ."
49732369,759964974,,86927809,Cary,Hosts were super hospitable and had great communication. Everything was better than expected and i would recommend this place to anyone! One of the best airbnb experiences ive had
48494600,3.96E+17,,87089904,Madeleine,"This is a lovely, clean, private and safe room! It has a sweet nature trail across the street and friendly neighbors. PCC is a 3 min drive away and beacon hill/Columbia City is a fun area with some lovely parks.<br/>I stayed here for a month with my 2 young children and it worked quite well for us. They loved the large driveway and the closet is nice and spacious. There isn't a TV but the WIFI works great. <br/>The host was wonderful. She checked in on us, was available if needed, but gave us lots of space and privacy. <br/>If you are looking for a nice clean airbnb for a great price in a cool neighborhood that is easily accessible to most parts of Seattle - I recommend this one!"
32793488,445621954,,87093215,Sophia,"Gorgeous, comfortable, modern apartment in a quiet, quaint neighborhood that’s still close to lots of great coffee shops and restaurants (5-10 min walk). If you’re looking for somewhere to base your Seattle exploration out of, this is it."
21888492,552494275,,87111660,Tyler,"Good place for what I needed. Nice to have lock on bedroom door. Because other Air Bnb people staying there, it can be noisy at any hour, got woken up several times. Other than that, it was good."
42510454,611344151,,87124101,Ma?gorzata,"This stylish space in a convenient location sets the bar high. It’s setup to Airbnb Plus standard with many special touches throughout the apartment. It works great for families, couples and business travelers. Easy checkin, plenty of extra towels/linens/blankets, uber clean, fast WIFI, comfortable beds, coffee/tea, Netflix...I really felt welcomed and at home! Wonderful space and wonderful host. And Tenth West Cafe (great breakfast if you don’t feel like cooking) and Coffee Mind (awesome Turkish coffee) are half a block away. Thank you for sharing, Alex! Highly recommended!"
41954289,7.22E+17,,87128345,Danelle,"The apartment was comfortable, clean and close to the UW campus. Nice to have parking in the driveway."
9579441,126036829,,8716833,David,"Matthew is fantastic! I requested to book this place a few hours before I was going to arrive. Matthew accepted immediately and got right to work to make sure that my check in was smooth.<br/>It turned out that he had only listed the apartment the night before, so there were a few minor issues with it, but he was very responsive and did everything possible to get the issues worked out.<br/>In general, the apartment is really nice. The view from the rooftop is great and the location is ideal. Some of the amenities in the apartment are not perfect - the bed was a little hard and the shower is old - but the apartment is cute, clean and functional."

4871348,24791725,,8760924,Katie,"We were Dominick's first guests for Airbnb and it was a great stay. This is a perfect space for a couple, he has all the amenities you need and was always able to answer any questions. Great private entrance, it felt like we had our own place. I will definitely recommend it to others couples traveling through Seattle!"

14410216,92959649,,88714410,Catharine,"Melissa's place was a great place for my mom and I to stay while we were visiting Seattle. The private home is nice and very clean. Melissa was also extremely quick to respond to my inquiries and very friendly and helpful when she did so. The home is a short walk to all kinds of restaurants--we had great pho one night that was a six-minute walk away. There are also two coffee shops, including a Starbucks, three blocks away. An uber ride to the UW/Husky Stadium Link station cost me ~$6.50. Everything is easily accessible from Melissa's place. This was my first Airbnb experience, and Melissa's apartment made it an enjoyable one. I would definitely recommend it!"
18485076,154091222,,88723,Lydia,"Adorable, immaculate Cottage. Beautiful furnishings, lovely linens. Very well stocked kitchen. Just perfect!"
47989863,738409705,,88811174,Jo,"Quite honestly, everything about our stay here was perfect. From the clear and useful house information provided to every detail of the house, comfort and function are front and center. The house is beautifully set up inside and out, in a great location and our host Melissa was gracious and helpful throughout."
28306348,327946638,,89028424,Elizabeth & Ryan,"We chose this property because of the AMAZING views of Puget Sound and the location in West Seattle. This Airbnb being apart of an occupied family home, had its drawbacks. We could hear everything going on upstairs and footsteps were rather loud above us. The property was adorable with many personal touches and amenities. The owner Joe was very accommodating and quick to respond to our needs and questions. Being the very first quests, we feel this place has amazing potential and we would definitely consider staying there again. The only major issue we had was a very loud dripping noise in the ceiling above our bed that forced us to change rooms. Being the attentive host/owner Joe seemed to be, we assume this issue will be addressed quickly."
27328475,305099902,,8905547,Michael,"A great location and the perfect place to call home for a few days. Plenty of space, a very comfortable bed, great kitchen amenities and a washer and dryer on site!"
30321371,448950045,,89148657,Whitney,"We loved our stay! Absolutely beautiful home, very high end luxury touches! The backyard was a great spot to read a book or have a glass of wine! We would love to stay again in the future! Highly recommend."
1684236,8154976,,8942402,Rex,"A pleasant hassle free experience staying with David.<br/><br/>Our first experience with Airbnb was rocky, being let down by three hosts in a row – why do those hosting not keep their booking schedules current? We selected and booked only one at a time, then had our deposit returned to start the process again. After three false starts we were becoming desperate to find a place on time, then David came to the rescue.<br/><br/>David was obliging enough to meets us at 11.15pm (admittedly he was just finishing vacuuming the place spotless), given a good rundown on the facilities, set us up with the free WIFI and off to a very comfortable Queen sized bed – (love the soft red duvet cover).<br/>Next day David was still considering his guests by installing new LED low temperature bedside reading lamps – much used and appreciated.<br/><br/>We were given an excellent value stay for two weeks in an apartment with a fine 13 story view in a solid older style building with excellent insulation and sound resistance. The freeway is close but the noise is a gentle hum more like a distant surf beach unless you wish to sleep with an open double glazed window which most would have no need. <br/><br/>Just adjacent the Conference Centre, it was easy walking distance downhill to Pikes Market, a bus from there to the Space Needle and return by bus, $2.25 to a stop 500yds from the apartment – location excellent for those without a car.<br/><br/>A good sized 42"" TV in a comfortable combined living room / kitchen, a good sized separate double bedroom, bathroom with good quality glass sliding shower doors over the bath and excellent storage facilities. All linen, towels, soap and spare toiletries in the cupboards along with an ironing board and iron.<br/><br/>Furniture is mostly new and contemporary with a comfortable leather lounge suite (loved the rotating arm chair) and a good book selection.<br/>The compact kitchen facilities includes a dishwasher, full sized cooker and refrigerator with microwave over – all necessary cookware, eating crockery and cutlery. Coffee and filters available for travellers who have not yet purchased their own stocks, was a nice touch along with the thoughtful chocolates.<br/><br/>We have given a detailed description of the facilities because David was off to Italy a few days later and had not the time to promote his apartment in the way most others do. Despite having little detail in the description, we were so glad we took the chance and correctly guessed that David and his apartment would be up to a reasonable standard – we were pleasantly surprised that it exceeded our expectations.<br/><br/>David, you will be the only person we contact for accommodation when next we are in Seattle (about January14) and you have our email address to stay with us when next you visit NZ – we must continue that chat about ecology and sustainability.<br/>Thanks again – Rex & Glenys<br/>"
38487282,559168107,,8943003,Tom,Space was exactly as described. Leigh’s place is incredibly well-stocked and has everything you need for a comfortable stay. The apartment is a few blocks from Main Street Ballard with tons of shops and restaurants. We really enjoyed our time here and wouldn’t hesitate to stay again if we’re in the neighborhood.

6101613,50625854,,9008994,Neil,"Mayza was very helpful. He met us at the house and showed us around and made sure we didn't have any questions. He had coffee, eggs and OJ for us to use. <br/><br/>The view really is as good as it looks. The deck would be a great place to hang out in the summer. The house layout worked well for us. My mom stayed upstairs and my wife, children, and I stayed in the two bedrooms downstairs. <br/><br/>It is very well located. It's an easy drive to UW and downtown Seattle."
50227512,5.52E+17,,90274161,David,Kelsey and Wes were great hosts! They clearly and promptly communicated with me before and during my stay. Their place was very clean and well decorated as well. I would be happy to stay here again!
15160598,106882651,,90275445,Brooke,Very comfortable and spacious studio space. About 15 minutes from downtown and in a great neighborhood. We only stayed for one night but it was perfect for what we were looking for and last minute. Thanks Mahi for taking us on!

5.44E+17,6.39E+17,,90558327,Cho,"I stayed here for 4 months. Very quiet neighborhood. Very comfortable bed, nice living room and bathroom. There’s not a kitchen but a drinking bar with a mini fridge, microwave, mini oven and a electric burner. you can make small easy meal with it! Owner is very responsive and helpful with any issues. Also it’s 5 mins walk to the Lincoln park, my dog love it! It’s a 5 stars airbnb. Would recommend any traveler for short or long stay."
48757774,755128721,,9058667,Carmela,"Loved our stay at this condo. It was walking distance to many cafes and restaurants and had great views. Jenette, who checked us in, gave us awesome suggestions for different places to visit!"
46036925,764436047,,90634409,Sherry,Juliet's place is conveniently located for a nice and comfortable stay near Lake Washington. A full community kitchen is spacious for meals and there are gathering tables throughout the home as well as available parking. All the rooms are well secured. A definite recommend!
21629468,210907202,,90761380,Scarlett,"Cosy, clean place to stay. Super easy check in. A bit far from central Seattle"
6.8E+17,7.41E+17,,9078379,Katherine Lisbeth,"The location is great and the place is gorgeous. You get a beautiful view of the city from the rooftop. The place was clean and spotless, we enjoyed our stay. There was a bit of a misunderstanding regarding the listing (which is new) but the hosts were very communicative, accepted our feedback and resolved the issue for us."
14683894,97356010,,91172520,Cedrick,"This place was super nice, quite and a perfect laid back spot to operate as home base. Light rail one way and buses the other, making a car useless here. The backyard over looks beacon hill,which I must say is the best view of all. House guests didn't hesitate to strike up a conversation,which made it feel more like home, Thanks Shan !"
19336206,208267719,,91197321,Lena,Very clean and cute setup! Quiet and peacefully neighborhood :)
2033191,13045023,,9128324,DeWitt,"My family and I stayed at Paul's wonderful Green Lake home for two weeks in May.<br/><br/>The downstairs apartment was ideal in every way for our extended visit. The bedrooms and living and dining rooms were spacious and offered plenty of light, (and a beautiful view of the lake right across the street), and the kitchen was fully equipped with every appliance and cooking utensil we could think of. Paul and his family have clearly made a tremendous effort to make their guests feel welcome, going out of their way to make sure we had everything we need.<br/><br/>The house itself couldn't be better located. We walked around the lake nearly every day, and there are a number of great restaurants and coffee shops within blocks. Street parking right next to the apartment was never an issue, even when the everyone came out to enjoy the beautiful weather on the lake.<br/><br/>We miss it already, and would happily recommend Paul's Green Lake home to anyone visiting Seattle anytime soon."
1265651,12744956,,9139514,Inger,I arranged housing with Melissa for a group of artists doing a residency at UW. I did not personally stay there but the company members all said it was acceptable.
26963720,302567118,,914630,Bill,"This place is nicely located, central to many of Seattle's neighborhoods (of which there are many). Most things were a $5 to $10 Uber ride and 15 minutes or less. The place easily handled our group of 4 (we needed 3 beds) and there was plenty of space. Nice view from upstairs of lots of Seattle.<br/>We appreciated the coffee, tea, bread, butter, jelly, etc as some of us got up earlier than others and it was nice to be able to eat/drink in the house while waiting for the rest of the party. Overall it was an excellent stay, lots of rooms, 2 bathrooms, hot water, towels, sheets, soap, and other amenities were all up to par.<br/>We had a great stay."
2536507,11310757,,9171798,Kristen,"Marian was such a wonderful host, she was prompt with correspondence and very friendly. The Beach House that we stayed in was more of a studio apartment, which we thought might be the case, and it was wonderful, great views of West Seattle and within walking distance of fabulous restaurants. <br/><br/>Parking on the hill was kinda tricky but other than that we had a great time and next time we visit Seattle Marian will be our first choice."
42201985,622871521,,9172811,Candice,"A gem! Tucked back on a quiet street yet a block away from Greenwood's sweet business district. There are coffee shops, cafes, a library and lots of small retail shops to explore. The host was amazing! Great communication from the start and easy to reach. She lives on site, yet we rarely saw her. My teenage son and I stayed for a couple days. His favorites were the corn hole, smores, Netflix and the comfy couch. Mine were the outdoor seating area, firepit, complimentary wine and coffee (super tasty), the big shower and the comfy bed. The place was the cleanest and one of the most stylish Airbnbs that I've found. Lots of towels, linens, games and tons of little touches. We'll be back and be sending our friends along too. Thank you!!"
41621212,598726057,,91973863,Enrique,"By Far this is nicest place I have been using Airbnb and I have on difference places in US and Europe. Mike put special attention to the details, you can see notes around the house that can help to use things. You have Alexa devices on every room and I loved the heated floor in the house and the fire place. The communication was excellent thru all the stay. The house is in a quiet neighborhood and it have plenty of parking space. At this point I can identified anything that can be done better was a perfect stay."
12573882,76324321,,92019,Grace,"Lucky me! I was Sabrina's first guesst at her stylish, efficient, and peaceful apartment/retreat. I enjoyed five restful nights at this one bedroom garden basement apartment. When I say ""garden"", I mean that in a literal sense as the windows open to grassres and blooms and French doors lead to a brick patio with a bistro table and chairs, potted plants, mature trees, and an emerald green lawn. <br/>Sabrina is a graphic artist/designer which eas evident in the apartment's decor. The furniture was chic and comfortable. A fully stocked kitchen was perfectly laid out. Textured appointments such as pillows, throw blankets, and table runners were colorful and functional accents.<br/>Lighting was provided by well placed lamps and ceiling pictures.<br/>In other words, if you have the great fortune of staying here, you'll be sleeping in Dwell Magazine. <br/>Also in the space, generous amenities abound: luscious coconut shampoo and ginger conditioner in a fresh tile shower, sodas in the fridge along with a carton of organic half and half, an excellent bed with the right amount of firmness and cuddly bed linens on top. <br/>Sabrina is a bright and sunny hostess and an excellent communicator. She texted me with thoughtful offers of fresh towels, if I needed anything more in the kitchen, and an explanation that the sound of drums and brass instruments that appeared out of nowhere was the neighborhood high school marching band practicing on the next block for the upcoming graduation. <br/>Sabrina's Airbnb is in the leafy splendor that is the neighborhood of Ravenna. Great walks are right out the door and it's an ideal location for accessing downtown, the University of Washington, Capitol Hill and other sweet neighborhoods.<br/>You cannot go wrong with this Airbnb. It should be on your wish list!"

573942,2048835,,923712,Danny,"Angielena was a most courteous and helpful hostess. The atmosphere of the building was totally interesting.and I would recommend this to anyone. The residents are artists and each one I met was a pleasure. The neighbornood is in an old part of Seattle that has been renovated and filled with shops, restaurants, and bars- all inviting and fun. I do not have anything on the negative side to add, as I have been in rooms all around the country and this is right at the top."
6.1E+17,8.94E+17,,92478199,Malgosia,"Favorite spot I’ve stayed at in Seattle! The location, interior design, and responsiveness of the host made this place 5 stars all around. Great restaurants, cafes, and bars nearby. I loved walking a block down for dinner at Cook Weaver after a drink at Corvus & Co. The space itself is full of natural light and is tucked into the cute part of Capitol Hill. If you’re looking for the perfect summer spot in Seattle, this is it!"
36135642,481991108,,92703732,Frank,This place was absolutely amazing! Melissa really did a great job with the layout and I felt right at home. It’s very quiet and the location is great. Definitely worth the stay. Whether you’re looking to get away or simply need a place to rest this is hands down the best I’ve experienced.

Large TV was great for watching movies. It is on a dead end street so parking was easy and no traffic noise. It is also down the street from the UW campus and the University Village, it was very convenient."
20425984,195267661,,9310077,Ken,"Chima is a fantastic host! Quick communicator and an overall good guy. Walking through the neighborhood may give you pause at first, but I assure you it's a safe area and Chima's house is in great shape. I was comfortable in my bedroom (space heater and TV in room) and even though there was another couple staying in the other room, I had no issues with noise or cleanliness (shared bathroom). Short walk to the light rail station that takes about 15-20 minutes to and from the airport and around 30 minutes to downtown Seattle which is very convenient. I highly recommend this listing. Thanks Chima!"

25371191,408550665,,93332119,Caroline,"This place is an absolute gem. Colette has created a beautiful upscale home away from home. She is a welcoming host, providing a few goodies to get one started, lovely bathroom products and even flowers on the table. The appliances are all brand new and highly efficient. The beds are very comfortable with plenty of extra pillows available. There are 2 big showers and the apartment worked well for 2 or 4 people.<br/>We were there for 3 weeks and did a lot of cooking but we were never in need of an item in this very well set up kitchen.<br/>The area is wonderful and Colette has created a complete guide to the systems in the house, to restaurant ideas and even bike or walking routes.<br/>We highly recommend this place!"
24410427,323059801,,93476282,Cornelius,"This place is brand new and very nice. It is perfectly appointed with nice touches to allow anyone to feel at home and comfortable. <br/>I came here for a business trip and appreciated the quiet and safe location that allowed a secure, off-street parking for my Mercedes. I would bring my family back and take full advantage of the beautiful loft bed at the next opportunity! <br/>The apartment allows for easy access to vibrant North Seattle neighborhoods like Ballard and Greenwood. Here it is easy to find live music, or unique restaurants and bars. It is a bonus to be located in close proximity to Northgate mall and the interstate. <br/> I cooked many meals in the clean and well laid out kitchen and appreciated all the utensils and nice cookware. I was not lacking for anything here. <br/>I also enjoyed fast wifi, and watched Netflix on the smart TV. <br/>Thank you for creating this wonderful option that business travelers and family's alike can take advantage of."
1773803,8144167,,9358205,Joe,"A cozy apartment in the middle of the university district. There's plenty to do nearby on ""the ave."" Also there's a farmer's market every Saturday which has locally grown vegetables/fruits/meats and cheeses. It was only about a twenty minute drive to get to most other areas or sites; the apartment is in a great location.<br/><br/>Sheldon is a wonderful host that will tell you everything you need to know about the city, as well as really making you feel at home. He's extremely easy to contact and always promptly answers any questions about where to eat or what to see. Sheldon even took us tailgating with him to a Seahawks game. He is very inviting and left us with a great experience."

Once I arrived, there were some nice breakfast items. very pleasant place with plenty of space to stretch out. The neighborhood is great, and I really enjoyed walking there, especially in the little park on the street. Lisa has made sure to provide everything the guest needs, from great towels and toiletries to a handful of breakfast items so that you don't need to rush out to go shopping.<br/><br/>The bed was comfortable, and the microwave and toaster were all I needed for my short stay. I only got to interact with Lisa a few times, but she was incredibly helpful and made every effort to address any questions I had. I would certainly recommend this property, and definitely recommend the host.<br/><br/>Thanks Lisa - you made my first week in Seattle safe and comfortable."

2762241,15045006,,9373202,Dan,Anne and Kelly's place was a great way for us to begin our relocation to Seattle. We needed a place that we could stay for a month while we were waiting for new house to become available. They were very accommodating to let us book their lovely apt for so long. We were the first Air BbB guests to stay with them so they wanted make sure we had the things we needed and were great about requests and suggestions. Having use of the garage to park and access the apt is a great feature that guest will enjoy. The amenities are lovely and we would recommend staying with Anne & Kelly to our friends.
27900515,312109455,,93736968,Jesse,Apartment was clean and spacious. Quick and easy walk to the bars and restaurants on University.

I found plenty of street parking (paid) less than a block away.
48075755,736845896,,93780524,Rachael,Devon and Allen were excellent hosts. The space was the perfect mix of modern and cozy. It is in a great location with walkability to local restaurants and a beautiful trail around the lake. This was the perfect home away from home while we visiting Seattle.

A delicious breakfast is provided- pastries from 'larsons' were amazing!Jackie gave us access to their private beach which you can walk along when the tide is out- lovely! Ballard is a 5 minute drive and has loads of cool places to eat and drink! Jackie and Hoa were very helpful and gave us lifts into Seattle on both days-I would definitely recommend having a car to get around, or using 'uber' which works out cheap! A great stay!"

The Casa is on a gorgeous tree lined street that offers a wonderful place to walk and admire Seattle architecture as well as an easy walk to the UW campus. We can't wait to visit again soon!"
24872672,282599223,,93953569,Gary,Really good place to stay and amazing views! Max is a nice person and easy to communicate. Only drawback is the place is a little dusty that is not convenient for bare foot inside the place.

Very easy and affordable to get to downtown or the sports stadiums via the bus (stop only a couple blocks away) or Uber. Stephen and Christy were great hosts.

45755073,714452807,,94505,Ennjoili,"What a beautiful home! Our 20 year old daughter stayed here and used the cottage as a quarantine location in order for her to come home for the holidays. The cottage is separate from the main house but on the same property. We liked that she didn’t ha e to share circulated site due to her being high risk. It was still very private, 2 stories, very clean with lots of natural light. The cottage and main home are both fenced in and felt very safe and secure. There is plenty of parking and the neighborhood was quiet so it was easy to get a full nights sleep. The cottage itself is very roomy and with nice decor. Our daughter was please to find her own washer and dryer in the unit too! The home is absolutely beautiful inside and out. Communication was very clear and the owners provided clear and detailed instructions that made it easy to checkin and get settled which we appreciated so much during this pandemic. Although the cottage is on the same property as the owners, it still felt like you were alone and they mostly kept to themselves. Our daughter ran into the hosts in passing and they were very friendly + brief interaction. Again, I cannot stress how pleased we were with the communication and appreciated them checking in with us to see if our daughter was settled in and if she needed anything. They were quick to respond to any questions we had. The location was also great; near a main road but far enough from noise and plenty of privacy. We would definitely use this place again."

We love to walk down the street to breakfast and back again for ice cream in the evening. <br/>Will and Kelly were super helpful and responsive to our requests. You can tell they take great pride in making their home welcoming. And the kitchen is fully outfitted to cook...we shopped at Pike Place market and feasted on Seattle’s best back at the hide-away! <br/>We will be back for sure!

We were welcome by both Bill and Micheal, taken to our amazing room then they gave us lots of ideas on what to do and where to eat. The room was really clean and very cozy. The room had a fridge full of waters, orange juice and fresh fruit. There was also a Keurig with coffee and tea pods. The key pad made it easy to go in and out of the residence and room. The location was perfect, less than a 10 minute walk to the Light Rail station. We also walked to Pike Place and it took about 25 minutes.

The house is clean and spacious with everything we needed for our stay. It was great to have a fully stocked kitchen, as we did cook several meals there. The beds were super cozy with warm comforters. We also loved time spent on the deck and watching movies on the big screen. This house is in a great location!! We loved how close it was to great restaurants, to the lovely walk around Green Lake, and it was just a few blocks from a very nice grocery store (PCC). There was plenty of parking right in front of the house, and it was super easy to cruise to Seattle Center or Downtown via Hwy 99 or I-5. We will definitely be staying here again in the future. <br/><br/>"

The home itself is also in a fantastic location! We were able to check out the arboretum close by as well as shops and downtown Seattle that was just a short drive away. Despite the couple hiccups we had during our stay, Jean was very responsive and accommodating in getting back to us with our needs. You can really tell that he cares about his guests.

Before booking this place, I messaged Rachael about how my boyfriend was 6'0'' tall and wanted to make sure the size of the bed was big enough for him. Rachael acknowledge my concern with the bed size and made a queen size bed before we arrived the first day. This was extremely thoughtful of her. In regards to the kids, they were overall well behaved.

48286305,739185030,,9793,Ryan,"Connor's place is amazing. The pictures simply don't do it justice. It's 3 floors of a brand new townhouse with floor-to-ceiling windows and a west-facing view. It's also great having use of a private garage to park and enter. Book this place on autopilot!<br/>I think we were among the first people to ever stay at the house and it exceeded our expectations. <br/>We have lived in Seattle off and on for 20 years and seldom have had the opportunity to explore Magnolia. It's an amazingly quiet neighborhood that's worth exploring in depth. Connor's home is an excellent jumping-off point to do so, only a few blocks from Magnolia Center--this cute 1950s ""main street"" where you will find cafes, coffee shops, food carts, grocery stores, and a gas station (If you have the chance, check out the Peruvian restaurant Pink Salt--we ate there twice!). You're also running distance to Discovery Park and close enough to walk to the Ballard locks.<br/>Connor is an exceptional host and super communicative. Responses took about 60 seconds. Highly recommended!"

50709546,4.07E+17,,98480257,Darby,Located in a cute and safe neighborhood close to downtown (15-ish minute drive).

18430634,154700409,,9873723,Rebecca,"We had such a great time staying at Debbie's apartment. She and Becky were terrific hosts and the apartment was freshly redone and clean as could be. You can really lead a pedestrian lifestyle here if you wish. Having Trader Joe's less than a block away was great, we could carry our groceries home. The bakery downstairs is to die for and they were super friendly also. This place is a fantastic rental, especially great if you are traveling with young children as I was, with my 8 month old, my 3 year old and my mom."

John was so extremely hospitable! The place was located within walking distance to the Space Needle. Super clean and made us feel at home immediately. Most comfortable beds we ever slept in! He even stocked us with a bottle of wine upon arrival, every coffee pod imaginable, not to mention candy and biscotti... And plenty of towels! We loved our visit and can't thank the owner enough for a wonderful stay. Thank you! I recommend everyone to book here. We will definitely be back!<br/>"

Hsiu's condo was very clean, beautifully decorated, and the kitchen and bath were stocked with great amenities (like a Nespresso machine!). The location is central and it was easy to walk everywhere from the Space Needle to Pike Place Market, with many great restaurants, bars, and shops in between. Hsiu's son was also incredibly helpful and gracious in handling my arrival/departure and all of my questions. I will be recommending this place to friends and returning next time I'm in Seattle."

9096972,56711305,,9978676,Alex & Natalie,"All in all, the stay went great! The view was awesome, and the apartment had everything we needed (full kitchen, living area, shower, comfortable bed). Kevin and Sue were great hosts; they respected our privacy, gave us a great dinner recommendation (Elliott Bay Brewery) and provided us some croissants and OJ for breakfast.<br/><br/>We should note that we're Seattle locals who just happened to run into some issues at our own place for the evening so we were already pretty familiar with the West Seattle area (which is awesome if you want to get out of the city without going very far). But regardless of where you're from, this place definitely provides for a fun and relaxing stay and an amazing view!"

52716129,8.54E+17,,9989115,Marcia,"We enjoyed an overnight at Mary's, but wish it could've been longer. Though the space is the lower portion of the house, the windows are large and let in plenty of light. You enter on grade via a level walkway. Easy to adapt window coverings gave us plenty of privacy. The bathroom and kitchen were small, but newly updated, nicely decorated and clean. We had all the amenities we needed with well thought out placement of furnishings. Very comfortable bed and bedding. Easy access to a grocery store and Westwood Village via a short drive. Highly recommend!"
8255615,47900033,,9991163,Greta,Our stay at the caboose was perfect! Super clean and a nice area in Ballard. Parking was super simple each day and Jennifer and her family were kind and attentive! Thanks and hope we get to stay again!
9820818,56981662,,9994696,Margaret,"This place is great and perfect for what we needed. Melissa emailed to see if there was anything she could do to make our stay more comfortable. The house is immaculately clean. Linens and pillows were high quality and very comfortable. Melissa is very well organized and provides all necessary information about the house and its amenities as well as extra information about local eateries and such. Although we didn't get a chance to take advantage of this, the provided bikes/helmets and trail that runs right by the house is a huge bonus. The neighborhood seemed pretty quiet which is nice. We would love to stay here again."
